The appellant was convicted under Section 20(b)\n\n</p><p id=\"p_4\">(ii)(B)     of    the   Narcotic   Drugs      and    <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1\">Psychotropic\n\nSubstances Act</a>, 1985 (hereinafter referred to as\n\n`the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_2\">NDPS Act</a>'), and sentenced to undergo rigorous\n\nimprisonment for three years and to pay a fine of\n\nRs.30,000/-       and   in    default    of   such    payment   to\n\nundergo simple imprisonment for three months.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                                                      2</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">3.     On 9th December, 2004, the appellant was found\n\nin   possession       of   1.61    Kgs.   of    Ganja.       Under   the\n\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_3\">NDPS Act</a>, 1 Kg. of Ganja has been\n\ndefined    to    be    \"small     quantity\"     and     20    Kgs.   and\n\nabove has been defined as \"commercial quantity\".\n\nWhen the seized Ganja was analyzed on 15th December,\n\n2004, the weight thereof together with jute bag and\n\nplastic carrying bag was found to be 1.595 Kgs. The\n\nGanja    alone,       without     the    jute   bag     and    plastic\n\ncarrying bag, weighed 1.31 Kgs.                  Before the High\n\nCourt, it was contended on behalf of the appellant\n\nthat once the moisture content of the seized Ganja\n\nwas excluded, the actual weight of the contraband\n\nwould    weigh    less     than    1    Kg.,    which    would       have\n\nattracted a punishment of imprisonment for a term\n\nwhich could extend to six months or fine, which\n\ncould extend to Rs.10,000/-, or with both. It was\n\nalso    submitted      that     the     expression      `Ganja',       as\n\ndefined in <a href=\"/doc/233441/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 2(i)(b)</a> of the NDPS Act, does\n\nnot include seeds and leaves when not accompanied\n\nby the tops. It was also submitted that the expert\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                                                   3</span>\n\n\n(PW.1) Mahesh Kaissare had not been able to specify\n\nthe weight of the flowery part alone or the leaves\n\nseparately.         It was prayed before the High Court\n\nthat in the circumstances since the appellant had\n\nalready undergone two months and six days out of\n\nthe     sentence,      the     same    be     considered     as    the\n\nsubstantive sentence and that the appellant would\n\ndeposit the fine in case the same has not been\n\ndeposited.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">4.    The High Court rejected the submission made on\n\nbehalf     of    the    appellant,          but   considering      the\n\nquantity    involved         which    was    little   over    1   Kg.,\n\nreduced    the    sentence      from    three     years'     rigorous\n\nimprisonment to one year's rigorous imprisonment.\n\nThe fine was, however, not reduced.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">5.    Not being satisfied with the order of the High\n\nCourt reducing the sentence from three years to one\n\nyear,     the    appellant      has    moved      this   Court    for\n\nfurther relief.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                                                     4</span><p id=\"p_9\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">6.

Learned     counsel    for     the    appellant      submitted\n\nthat having regard to the definition of \"Ganja\" in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/744415/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 2(iii)(b)</a> of the NDPS Act, the seeds and\n\nleaves     ought     not     to     have    been    included      while\n\nweighing the seized contraband since the same was\n\nnot     accompanied     by    tops.         It     was    urged     that\n\nexcluding the seeds and leaves the actual weight of\n\nthe seized Ganja would be below 1 Kg. which would\n\nattract a much lesser punishment of imprisonment\n\nfor a term which could extend to six months or with\n\nfine, which could extend to Rs.10,000/-, or with\n\nboth.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">8.     Learned     counsel    for     the    appellant      submitted\n\nthat    the   order    of     the    High    Court       reducing    the\n\nperiod of sentence to one year was erroneous since\n\nthe seized Ganja would be less than 1 Kg. and could\n\nnot,    therefore,     be     taken    to    comprise      commercial\n\nquantity.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                                                    5</span><p id=\"p_14\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">9.

The submissions made by learned counsel for the\n\nappellant      are   not     convincing         since    from     the\n\nevidence on record it has been established that the\n\nseized Ganja consisted of a greenish brown colour\n\nleafy   and    flowery     parts     of   the   plant   (in     moist\n\ncondition) which, in terms of the definition of the\n\nexpression     \"Ganja\",      would      include   the   seeds     and\n\nleaves of the cannabis plant since the seized Ganja\n\nwas accompanied by the flowery parts of the plant.\n\nAs far as exclusion of the moisture content of the\n\nseized Ganja is concerned, there is nothing in the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_7\">NDPS    Act</a>   to   suggest    that      when    the   weight    of       a\n\nquantity      of   Ganja     is    to     be    ascertained,     the\n\nmoisture content has to be separately ascertained\n\nand excluded.        On the other hand, we are of the\n\nview that the weight of the contraband would be the\n\nweight taken at the time of seizure.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                                 7</span>\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">12.

Leave granted.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">2.    Challenge in this appeal is to the grant of bail to respondent No.2 who\n\nhad applied for bail during the pendency of the proceedings relating to FIR\n\nNo.20/2007 Police Station, Syala, District Jalore.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">3.    A learned Single Judge of the Rajasthan High Court at Jodhpur\n\nallowed the bail application. The High Court stated that the question as to\n\nwhether respondent No.2 was to be added as an accused is the subject\n\fmatter of examination by the High Court, while considering the scope and\n\nambit of <a href=\"/doc/481610/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 169</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short\n\n`Code'). The High Court did not examine the case on merits and on that\n\nscore alone accepted the prayer for bail. It needs to be noted that learned\n\nSessions Judge, Jalore, had rejected the bail application on considering the\n\nnature of allegations against the present respondent No.2.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">4.    The informant had filed the present appeal questioning grant of bail\n\nto respondent No.2. It is submitted that contrary to the view expressed by\n\nthis Court in a large number of cases, without indicating any reason the\n\norder granting bail was passed. Learned counsel for the State supported the\n\nstand of the appellant. On the contrary learned counsel for respondent No.2\n\nsubmitted that the scope and ambit of <a href=\"/doc/435819/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 319</a> Cr.P.C. was elucidated by\n\nthis Court in <a href=\"/doc/1713684/\" id=\"a_3\">Dharam Pal &amp; Ors. v. State of Haryana &amp; Anr</a>. (2004 (13) SCC\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">9) and, therefore, the High Court was justified in granting bail.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">5.    The parameters to be kept in view while dealing with an application\n\nfor bail have been indicated by this Court in several cases; for example\n\n<a href=\"/doc/500640/\" id=\"a_4\">Anwari Begum v. Sher Mohd</a>. (2005 (7) SCC 325), <a href=\"/doc/1870696/\" id=\"a_5\">Chaman Lal v. State of\n\nU.P</a>. (2004 (7) SCC 525), <a href=\"/doc/427330/\" id=\"a_6\">Anil Kumar Tulsiyani v. State of U.P</a>. (2006 (9)\n\nSCC 425) and State represented by Inspector of Police, T.N. v. Eslian @\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                     2</span>\n\fJothi Basu (2006 (9) SCC 785). It has been held that the court considering\n\nthe bail application has to consider among other circumstances the\n\nfollowing:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">      (i) the nature of accusations and the severity of punishment in case of\n\nconviction and the nature of supporting evidence; (ii) reasonable\n\napprehension of tampering with the witness or apprehension of threat to the\n\ncomplainant, and (iii) prima facie satisfaction of the court in support of the\n\ncharge.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">6.    In that view of the matter we set aside the impugned order of the High\n\nCourt and remit the matter to it for fresh consideration. Needless to say that\n\nthe High Court shall dispose of the matter by a reasoned order.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">7.

Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a learned Single Judge\n\nof the Kerala High Court allowing the Revision Petition filed by the State.\n\nChallenge before the High Court was to the order dated 20.11.1998 in\n\nCriminal M.C. No.2081 of 1997 passed by learned First Additional Sessions\n\nJudge, Trivandrum. The issue related to the scope and ambit of <a href=\"/doc/661069/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 341</a>\n\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short the `Code'). The High\n\nCourt examined the question as to whether a person who had not filed an\n\napplication as required under <a href=\"/doc/908644/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 340</a> of Code could file an appeal\n\funder <a href=\"/doc/661069/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 341</a> of the Code. The High Court held that a person who had\n\nnot filed complaint and the proceedings were initiated suo motu by the\n\nCourt could not file an appeal.

Learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand submitted that\n\nthe appellant is taking varying stands at different points of time and in the\n\norder impugned before the High Court not only the parameters of <a href=\"/doc/908644/\" id=\"a_5\">Section\n\n340</a> and <a href=\"/doc/661069/\" id=\"a_6\">341</a> were under consideration but also the other relevant aspects.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">4.    <a href=\"/doc/661069/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 341</a> reads as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">              \"341-Appeal-(1)- Any person on whose application any\n              Court other than a High Court has refused to make a\n              complaint under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) of\n              <a href=\"/doc/908644/\" id=\"a_8\">section 340</a>, or against whom such a complaint has been\n              made by such Court, may appeal to the Court to which\n              such former Court is subordinate within the meaning of\n              sub-section (4) of <a href=\"/doc/875455/\" id=\"a_9\">section 95</a>, and the superior Court may\n              thereupon, after notice to the parties concerned, direct\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                      2</span>\n\f             the withdrawal of the complaint or, as the case may be,\n             making of the complaint which such former Court might\n             have made under <a href=\"/doc/908644/\" id=\"a_10\">section 340</a>, and if it makes such\n             complaint, the provisions of that section shall apply\n             accordingly.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">             (2) An order under this section and subject to any such\n             order, an order under <a href=\"/doc/908644/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 340</a>, shall be final, and\n             shall not be subject to revision.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_8\">5.    A bare reading of the provisions makes it clear that an appeal under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/661069/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 341</a> can be filed by any person on whose application the Court other\n\nthan the High Court refused to make a complaint under sub-section (1) or\n\nsub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/908644/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 340</a>. The other person who can file an appeal is\n\none against whom such a complaint has been made by such Court.\n\nUndisputedly, the present case was one where the initiation was suo motu\n\nby the High Court. The effect of decision of the Court which took suo motu\n\naction not to proceed further appears to have kept in mind by the legislature\n\nwhile enacting <a href=\"/doc/51872/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 341(1)</a>. Sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/661069/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 341</a> is relevant for\n\nthe purpose of this case. It states that an order under <a href=\"/doc/661069/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 341</a> and subject\n\nto any such order, an order under <a href=\"/doc/908644/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 340</a> shall be final and shall not be\n\nsubject to revision. In other words there is legal embargo created on filing a\n\nrevision in respect of an order under <a href=\"/doc/908644/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 340</a> which cannot be the\n\nsubject matter of challenge. Undisputedly, what was challenged before the\n\nHigh Court was an order under <a href=\"/doc/908644/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 340</a> by the State of Kerala. The High\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                     3</span>\n\fCourt was justified in holding that no appeal can be filed by the State under\n\nSection 341 of the Act. But its conclusions about maintainability of the\n\nrevision are indefensible in view of the clear language of sub-section (2) of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/661069/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 341</a>. It appears that the High Court has made certain observations\n\nagainst the officers which do not in our view warrant interference.\n\nTherefore, the impugned order of the High Court regarding the\n\nmaintainability of the revision stands set aside.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">6.

On   21st   December,   1998,      while   the   Appellant\n\nNo.2 herein was riding a scooter belonging to the\n\nAppellant No.1, Krishan Gopal Thakur, there was an\n\naccident in which the said scooter and a Himachal\n\nRoad Transport Corporation bus which was proceeding\n\nfrom Kullu towards Manali, were said to have been\n\ninvolved.      According to the claimants, the accident\n\nhad   occurred      on   account    of   rash    and   negligent\n\ndriving of the driver of the bus as well as the\n\ndriver of the scooter.             As far as the owner and\n\ndriver of the bus are concerned, it was their case\n\nthat no collusion had at all taken place between\n\nthe scooter and the bus.             However, as far as the\n\nappellants are concerned, it is their case that the\n\nscooter was being driven by the deceased himself\n\nand the Appellant No.2 was the pillion rider on the\n\nscooter. According to them, the accident had taken\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                                                                 4</span>\n\n\nplace       due     to    rash       and    negligent          driving    of     the\n\ndriver of the bus in question.                            On the materials\n\nbefore it the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal came\n\nto the conclusion that the claimants had failed to\n\nprove        that        the     accident         had     occurred       due     to\n\nnegligence          of     the      bus     driver       and    dismissed       the\n\nclaim petition accordingly.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">6.     In     appeal,          it    was     observed          that     the    main\n\nquestion which arose in the appeal was as to who\n\nwas     driving          the        scooter       at     the     time     of     the\n\naccident. In the FIR (FIR No.255 of 1998) it has\n\nbeen    shown        that        the       same    was    recorded        at     the\n\ninstance of Jitender Thakur son of Krishan Kumar,\n\nwho     is     the        Appellant          No.2       herein.          The     FIR\n\nindicates that the complainant, Jitender Thakur and\n\ndeceased Jitender Sharma, had gone to Haripur and\n\nwere,       thereafter,             coming        on    his     scooter        which\n\nskidded on some sand lying on the road.                                   At the\n\nsame time, one HRTC bus came from the opposite side\n\nwhich, however, did not hit the scooter and they\n\nhad    suffered           the       injuries       even       before     the    bus\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                                               5</span>\n\n\nreached them. The accident was, however, witnessed\n\nby one Rewati Devi, who was examined as PW.5 and\n\ndeposed    that   while   she   was   drinking     tea    in   the\n\nDhaba   of    Milap    Chand,   she   saw    Jitender     Thakur\n\ndriving the scooter with Jitender Sharma sitting as\n\nthe pillion rider.           At the same time, a bus was\n\ncoming from the opposite side and collided with the\n\nscooter due to the fault of both the bus driver as\n\nalso the driver of the scooter.             She also deposed\n\nthat Jitender Sharma who was sitting at the pillion\n\nof the scooter, died as the handle of the scooter\n\npierced his stomach. She categorically stated that\n\nthe scooter did not skid on the spot as had been\n\nindicated in the First Information Report.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">7.   From what has been mentioned hereinabove, there\n\nappears to be two versions of the accident in which\n\nJitender Sharma died.         The version of the claimant\n\nis that the scooter in question was being driven by\n\nJitender     Thakur,   the   Appellant      No.2   herein,     and\n\nthat the deceased was the pillion rider.                 Jitender\n\nThakur, who was also the complainant, had, at the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                                              6</span>\n\n\ninitial stage while lodging the First Information\n\nReport, stated that the scooter had slipped on a\n\npatch of sand and that the bus was not involved in\n\nthe accident and that injuries to the deceased had\n\nalready occurred before the bus reached the scene\n\nof the accident.        Subsequently, however, he changed\n\nhis     tune   and    contended     that   the    accident   had\n\noccurred       on    account   of   the    rash    driving   and\n\nnegligence of the bus driver.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">8.    Apart from the said two conflicting versions of\n\nthe incident, as depicted by the Appellant No.2,\n\nthere is another dispute as to who was actually\n\ndriving    the      scooter    belonging   to     the   Appellant\n\nNo.1.     While it has been claimed by the Appellant\n\nNo.2 that it was the deceased who was driving the\n\nscooter and that he was the pillion rider and was\n\nnot, therefore, responsible for the accident, his\n\nversion has been contradicted by P.W.5 Rewati Devi,\n\nwho has categorically stated that she had witnessed\n\nthe accident and that it was the Appellant No.2 who\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                                                    7</span>\n\n\nwas driving the scooter and that the deceased was a\n\npillion rider.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">9.    The trial court accepted the version of the\n\nAppellant No.2 that he was the pillion rider while\n\nthe     deceased     was       driving     the       scooter        and\n\nconsequently came to a finding that the complainant\n\nhad not been able to prove that the Appellant No.2\n\nwas responsible for the accident in which Jitender\n\nSharma    died    and,   therefore,       rejected      the       claim\n\npetition of the respondents herein.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">10. The High Court, however, in appeal accepted the\n\nversion of the accident as narrated by P.W.5 Rewati\n\nDevi and has come to a definite finding that it was\n\nnot the deceased, but the Appellant No.2 who was,\n\nin    fact,   driving    the    scooter.       The    High    Court,\n\ntherefore,       disagreed     with      the   finding       of     the\n\nTribunal that the deceased was himself responsible\n\nfor the accident and held the Appellant No.2 to be\n\nthe only person responsible for the accident and\n\nthat since the Appellant No.1 was the owner of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                                                      8</span>\n\n\nscooter,        he        too     was     liable     for    payment   of\n\ncompensation          to         the    claimants,     who      are   the\n\nrespondents herein.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_18\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">11. From    the       facts        as    narrated    hereinabove,     the\n\nview   taken         by    the     High    Court,     relying    on   the\n\nevidence        of        P.W.5,        does   not    appear     to   be\n\nimprobable.          Apart from the fact that P.W.5 was the\n\nonly eye-witness to the actual accident, the High\n\nCourt has also disbelieved the version projected on\n\nbehalf     of        the        appellants     on    account     of   the\n\ndifferent stands taken by the Appellant No.2 as to\n\nhow the accident actually occurred.                        While at the\n\nvery initial stage it had been contended by the\n\nAppellant No.2 that the accident had occurred even\n\nbefore the bus had arrived at the scene, at a later\n\nstage it was contended that it was the bus driver's\n\nnegligence which had caused the accident.                       The High\n\nCourt also took note of the fact that the Appellant\n\nNo.2 had not come forward to be examined as to how\n\nthe accident had actually taken place.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                                      9</span>\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">12. The reversal of the Award of the Motor Accident\n\nClaims Tribunal by the High Court cannot be said to\n\nbe perverse or without any basis and we see no\n\nreason to interfere with the same.     The appeal is,\n\naccordingly,   dismissed,   with   costs   assessed   at\n\nRs.20,000/-.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_21\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">                                    ________________J.\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">                                       (ALTAMAS KABIR)\n\n\n\n                                    ________________J.\n</p><p id=\"p_24\">                                       (CYRIAC JOSEPH)\nNew Delhi\nDated: 18.2.2009\n\f</p>","tid":1811769,"showurl":true,"citeList":[]}, {"numcites":0,"covertids":[],"covertitles":[],"relatedqs":[{"value":"janaki raman","formInput":"janaki%20raman"},{"value":"a. raman ","formInput":"a.%20raman%20"},{"value":"pasayat","formInput":"pasayat"},{"value":"pondicherry","formInput":"pondicherry"},{"value":"arijit pasayat","formInput":"arijit%20pasayat"},{"value":"illicit","formInput":"illicit"}],"firstname":null,"title":"State Rep.By ... vs M.

Challenge in these appeals is to the judgment of acquittal recorded by\n\na learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court. The respondents were\n\naccused in C.C.No.195 of 1991 on the file of Chief Judicial Magistrate,\n\nPondicherry. Both of them were convicted for offences punishable under\n\nSections 31, 33, 37(a) and 38(1) of Pondicherry Excise Act, 1970 (in short\n\fthe `Act') and each of them were sentenced             to undergo rigorous\n\nimprisonment for six months under each head and the sentences were\n\nordered to run concurrently and fine of Rs.10,000/- with default stipulation\n\nwas imposed. Appeals were preferred by the accused persons and learned\n\nIInd Additional Sessions Judge, Pondicherry affirmed the conviction so far\n\nas offence punishable under Sections 31, 33 and 37(a) are concerned. But\n\nthe sentences were modified. The accused persons filed a Criminal Revision\n\npetitions before the Madras High Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">2.    Background facts in a nutshell are as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">      On 28.4.1990 at 7.30 a.m. Tahsildar (Excise) Visanathan (PW-5)\n\nalongwith his officials and police party went on a routine raid and they\n\nreceived information that some people were indulging in manufacturing\n\nillicit Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMPL) at Aranganoor. They reached\n\nAranganoor and when they went near the unfinished house of accused No.1\n\nJanakiraman, they noticed the smell of arrack coming from that house. On\n\nseeing them, a person who was standing there, ran away and they found a\n\nlady there. On enquiry, they came to know that she was Vasantha @\n\nKumari, the daughter-in-law of Janakiraman and the person who ran away\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                    2</span>\n\ffrom there, was accused No.2 Settu another son of Janakiraman and the\n\nhouse belonged to accused No.1. Janakiraman. Excise Officer, Viswanathan\n\n(P.W.5) found a room in the house locked. When enquired, Vasantha told\n\nthem that the key was with accused No.2 who ran away from there.\n\nThereupon, the lock was broken and they went inside and saw 2000 bottles\n\ncontaining illicit   liquor (manufactured brandy) and they also found\n\napparatus and other items for manufacturing illicit brandy alongwith empty\n\nbottles. Viswanathan (P.W.5) seized the materials under cover of Mahazar\n\nin the presence of Vasantha and Assistant Inspector. P.W registered a case\n\nin Crime No.4 of 1990 under Sections 31, 33, 37(a) and 38(1) of the Act and\n\nsent the samples for chemical analysis. He examined the witnesses and\n\nmade the final report. The trial Court and the first Appellate Court found\n\nthe accused persons guilty.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">      The High Court by the impugned order allowed the Revision\n\nPetitions.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">3.    In support of the appeals, learned counsel for the appellant-State\n\nsubmitted that the High Court's judgment is practically non-reasoned. It\n\ndoes not refer to the factual scenario or the evidence. Mere reference has\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                   3</span>\n\fbeen made to certain judgments of the High Court and this Court without\n\neven indicating as to how they are relevant for the purpose of this case.\n\nLearned counsel for the respondents supported the judgment of the High\n\nCourt.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">4.       We find that the only reason indicated by the High Court to direct\n\nacquittal reads as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">               \"Chapter VIII of Pondicherry Excise Act deals with\n               detection, investigation and trial of offences and its\n               empowers the excise officers to conduct search to seize\n               the articles liable for confiscation, to arrest without\n               warrant to conduct investigation and to complete it since\n               the excise officer is empowered to conduct search and is\n               also entitled to make investigation and complete the\n               same in accordance with law. The fact that the\n               complainant himself conducted investigation in the\n               present case would not vitiate the proceedings. The\n               contention of the petitioners that the procedure adopted\n               by PW-5 in filing the complaint and conducting the\n               investigation are vitiated by illegality cannot be\n               accepted.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p_14\">5.       The evidence of the witnesses and the conclusions of the trial Court\n\nand the first Appellate Court have not been referred to at all. When two\n\ncourts had found the accused persons guilty, the High Court has even not\n\nindicated as to how the conclusions of the trial Court and the Appellate\n\ncourt were without any basis or not sustainable. The manner of disposal of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                      4</span>\n\fthe Revision Petitions leaves much to be desired.

Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the\n\nBombay High Court upholding the conviction of the appellant for offence\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 302</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the\n\n`<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a>').\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">2.    Prosecution version in a nutshell is as follows:\n\f      On 13.2.1986 Police Head Constable Dinkar Shankar Dumbre (PW-\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">1) was attached to Railway Police Head Quarters at Ghatkopar. At the\n\nrelevant time, his nature of work was to receive the telephonic message\n\nfrom outside and convey the said message to the Railway Reserve Inspector.\n\nOn 13.2.1986 at about 1845 hrs. Mr. Gavade Head Constable came and\n\ninformed Dinkar Dumbre (PW1) that in Room No.41 of building No.24, one\n\nlady is lying in injured condition in a pool of blood. The said constable also\n\ninformed that he came to know about the said fact from the ladies residing\n\nin the said building. On receipt of this message Dinkar Dumbre (PW1)\n\nproceeded to the place of incident. He noticed one lady lying in pool of\n\nblood in the bath room of the house. Dinkar Dumbre (PW1) appointed one\n\npolice constable to guard the said place of incident and he proceeded to\n\ninform the said fact to RSI, Caze. Dinkar Dumbre (PW1) also informed the\n\nabove said fact to Tilak Nagar police station. The police from Tilak Nagar\n\npolice station arrived at the place of incident. The statement of PWI was\n\nrecorded by Tilak Nagar police which was treated as First Information\n\nReport. After investigation, charge sheet was filed.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">      Prosecution examined 12 witnesses to substantiate its accusations and\n\nthe trial was held as the accused pleaded innocence.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                     2</span>\n\f      The trial Court found the evidence to be sufficient to fasten the guilt\n\non the accused. Questioning the conviction and the sentence of\n\nimprisonment for life as awarded by learned Additional Sessions Judge,\n\nGreater Bombay, an appeal was filed before the Bombay High Court which\n\ncame to be dismissed by the impugned judgment. As the case rested on\n\ncircumstantial evidence the trial Court and the High Court analysed the\n\nevidence with great detail and held the accused guilty. The appeal did not\n\nbring any relief.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">3.    In support of the appeal, learned counsel for the appellant submitted\n\nthat the circumstances have not been established to find him guilty.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">4.    Learned counsel for the respondent-State on the other hand supported\n\nthe judgment.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">5.    The circumstances highlighted by the trial Court and the High Court\n\nto find the accused persons are as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">      (i)    That the accused and the victim were last seen together;\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                    3</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">\f      (ii)    The victim was lying dead in the pool of blood and the\n\n      accused was not there.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">      (iii)   Previous enmity and therefore intention to kill is proved;\n\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">      (iv)    PWs 6 and 7 clearly refer to the conduct of the accused\n\n      for ill treating and harassing the victim prior to the date of\n\n      incident.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_18\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">6.    It has been consistently laid down by this Court that where a case\n\nrests squarely on circumstantial evidence, the inference of guilt can be\n\njustified only when all the incriminating facts and circumstances are found\n\nto be incompatible with the innocence of the accused or the guilt of any\n\nother person.

The\n\ncircumstances from which an inference as to the guilt of the accused is\n\ndrawn have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt and have to be shown to\n\nbe closely connected with the principal fact sought to be inferred from those\n\ncircumstances. <a href=\"/doc/9122/\" id=\"a_9\">In Bhagat Ram v.

Sir Alfred Wills in his admirable book \"Wills' Circumstantial\n\nEvidence\" (Chapter VI) lays down the following rules specially to be\n\nobserved in the case of circumstantial evidence: (1) the facts alleged as the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                    6</span>\n\fbasis of any legal inference must be clearly proved and beyond reasonable\n\ndoubt connected with the factum probandum; (2) the burden of proof is\n\nalways on the party who asserts the existence of any fact, which infers legal\n\naccountability; (3) in all cases, whether of direct or circumstantial evidence\n\nthe best evidence must be adduced which the nature of the case admits; (4)\n\nin order to justify the inference of guilt, the inculpatory facts must be\n\nincompatible with the innocence of the accused and incapable of\n\nexplanation, upon any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt, (5)\n\nif there be any reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused, he is entitled as\n\nof right to be acquitted\".\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_31\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_32\">11.   There is no doubt that conviction can be based solely on\n\ncircumstantial evidence but it should be tested by the touch-stone of law\n\nrelating to circumstantial evidence laid down by the this Court as far back as\n\nin 1952.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_33\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_34\">12.   In Hanumant Govind Nargundkar and Anr. V. State of Madhya\n\nPradesh, (AIR 1952 SC 343), wherein it was observed thus:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                   \"It is well to remember that in cases where the\n             evidence is of a circumstantial nature, the circumstances\n             from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should\n             be in the first instance be fully established and all the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                     7</span>\n\f             facts so established should be consistent only with the\n             hypothesis of the guilt of the accused.

Therein, while dealing\n\nwith circumstantial evidence, it has been held that onus was on the\n\nprosecution to prove that the chain is complete and the infirmity of lacuna in\n\nprosecution cannot be cured by false defence or plea.           The conditions\n\nprecedent in the words of this Court, before conviction could be based on\n\ncircumstantial evidence, must be fully established. They are:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">             (1) the circumstances from which the conclusion of\n             guilt is to be drawn should be fully established.

Satish</a> [2005 (3) SCC 114]\n\nit was noted as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_41\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">            \"22.

The cumulative effect of the circumstances, as highlighted above,\n\nwhen considered in the background of legal principles stated supra it is but\n\nclear that the accusations have been established by the prosecution.

Though the High Court's\n\njudgment is not very elaborate, but that cannot take away the effect of\n\nelaborate discussions made by the trial Court to find the accused persons\n\nguilty.

The present appeal has a slightly chequered history.          Land\n\nacquisition proceedings were initiated in respect of the land, bearing\n\nSurvey No. 4 of Beratana Agrahara Village, Begur Hobli, Bangalore South\n\nTaluk, measuring 35 guntas, belonging to the appellant.        Section 4\n\nNotification dated 29.11.1990 was published on 20.12.1990. After Section\n\n5-A enquiry, declaration under <a href=\"/doc/1792838/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 6</a> of the Land Acquisition Act\n\n(hereinafter referred to as `the Act') was published on 18.6.1992. In the\n\naward proceedings dated 9.12.1994, the compensation was determined at\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                   2</span>\n\nRs.10/- per square feet. An application for enhancement under <a href=\"/doc/1517117/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 18</a>\n\nof the Act was filed by the appellant and Reference Court partly allowed the\n\nReference and enhanced the compensation to Rs.27.50 per square feet.\n\nThe appellant was also held to be entitled to solatium at 30% of the market\n\nvalue and for additional amount at 12% p.a. under <a href=\"/doc/31609/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 23</a>(1-<a href=\"/doc/1656199/\" id=\"a_4\">A) of the\n\nAct</a>. The Reference Court accepted that this was non-agricultural land and\n\nwas situated adjacent to the Highway and thus, it had potential for being\n\nused for commercial purpose. The public purpose for which the land was\n\nacquired, was for widening of the National Highway.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">3.    Dissatisfied by the judgment of the Reference Court, an appeal was\n\nfiled before the High Court. The High Court set aside the order of the\n\nReference Court, enhancing the compensation and strangely enough held\n\nthat the Reference Court had erred in enhancing the compensation.\n\nAggrieved by the judgment of the High Court, the appellant filed a Special\n\nLeave Petition, being SLP (Civil) No. 8575 of 2006 before this Court. This\n\nCourt, by its order dated 26.2.2007, set aside the judgment and remanded\n\nthe matter to the High Court to consider the appeal afresh. Accordingly,\n\nthe High Court heard the matter again and partly allowed the appeal,\n\nenhancing the compensation amount at Rs.75/- per square feet. However,\n\nthe High Court deducted Rs.25/- per square feet for development charges.\n\nThe High Court also did not award the compensation towards yielding\n\ncoconut trees, barbed fencing wire etc.      Aggrieved by that order, the\n\nappellant, now, has come before us by way of the present appeal.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                   3</span>\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">4.    The Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant urged\n\nthat considering that this land was on the outskirts of Bangalore City and\n\nhad the great commercial potential, the High Court was bound to give\n\nenhanced compensation, at least at the rate of Rs.100/- per square feet. It\n\nwas pointed out that the acquired land was on the National Highway and as\n\nsuch, had the potential for commercial purposes. The Learned Counsel\n\nfurther, by way of his second submission, urged that the High Court, at any\n\nrate, should not have deducted Rs.25/- per square feet, so as to limit the\n\ncompensation to Rs.50/- per square feet. The Learned Counsel pointed\n\nout that such deduction for development charges was completely\n\nunjustified, particularly, because there could be no development in the\n\nsmall piece of land.   The Learned Counsel relied upon the judgment\n\nreported in 2007 (9) SCC 447.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">5.    As against this, the Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nrespondent, supported the impugned judgment and contended that in fact,\n\nthe High Court had given much more compensation than what was actually\n\ndeserved by the appellant.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">6.    The High Court has increased the compensation from Rs.27.50/- per\n\nsquare feet to Rs.75/- per square feet. In the impugned judgment, the High\n\nCourt observed that the concerned land was abutting the National Highway\n\nand was within 15 kilometers from Bangalore City Corporation limit and\n\nfurther that all-round development has taken place as industries have come\n\nup thereby. In this, the High Court relied upon a Division Bench judgment\n\npassed by the same High Court, wherein, it was found that the value of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                      4</span>\n\nnearby land was Rs.62.50/- per square feet. The High Court ultimately\n\nheld that since the said land referred to in the earlier judgment passed by it\n\nwas 25-30 kilometers away from Bangalore Bus Station, the present land\n\nwould deserve a better rate than the one given in the earlier judgment,\n\nsince it was only 15 kilometers away from the Bus Station. Accordingly,\n\nthe High Court recorded a finding that the rate of Rs.75/- per square feet\n\nwould be a proper rate. We are satisfied with this finding of the High Court,\n\nas the Learned Counsel has not been able to show anything from the\n\nrecord to hold that the concerned land would deserve a higher price than\n\nthe one awarded by the High Court. We are generally satisfied with the\n\nfinding of the High Court and would choose to confirm the same. Thus, we\n\nhold that the High Court was right in awarding the rate of Rs.75/- per\n\nsquare feet for the concerned land.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">7.    That leaves us with the other question of deduction ordered by the\n\nHigh Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">8.    The High Court has directed the deduction of Rs.25/- per square\n\nfeet. Unfortunately, the High Court has not discussed the reason for this\n\ndeduction of Rs.25/- per square feet nor has the High Court relied on any\n\npiece of evidence for that purpose. It is true that where the lands are\n\nacquired for public purpose like setting up of industries or setting up of\n\nhousing colonies or other such allied purposes, the acquiring body would\n\nbe entitled to deduct some amount from the payable compensation on\n\naccount of development charges, however, it has to be established by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                    5</span>\n\npositive evidence that such development charges are justified.           The\n\nevidence must come for the need of development contemplated and the\n\npossible expenditure for such development.       We do not find any such\n\ndiscussion in the order of the High Court. As if this is not sufficient, when\n\nwe see the judgment of the Principal Civil Judge (Sr. Division), Bangalore,\n\nRural District, Bangalore in Reference proceedings, we find that there is no\n\ndeduction ordered for the so-called development charges.           We are,\n\ntherefore, not in a position to understand as to from where such\n\ndevelopment charges sprang up.          The Learned Counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the respondents was also unable to point out any such evidence\n\nregarding the proposed development. We cannot ignore the fact that the\n\nland is acquired only for widening of the National Highway. There would,\n\ntherefore, be no question of any such development or any costs therefor.\n\nIn the reported judgment in Nelson Fernandes and Others Vs. Special\n\nLand Acquisition Officer, South Goa and Others in 2007(9) SCC 447,\n\nthis Court has discussed the question of development charges. That was a\n\ncase, where, the acquisition was for laying a Railway line.      This Court\n\nfound that the land under acquisition was situated in an area, which was\n\nadjacent to the land already acquired for the same purpose, i.e., for laying\n\nRailway line.    In paragraph 29, the Court observed that the Land\n\nAcquisition Officer, the District Judge and the High Court had failed to\n\nnotice that the purpose of acquisition was for Railways and that the\n\npurpose is a relevant factor to be taken into consideration for fixing the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                    6</span>\n\ncompensation.      The Court relied on judgment in Viluben Jhalejar\n\nContractor Vs. State of Gujarat reported in 2005(4) SCC 789, where it\n\nwas held that the purpose for which the land is acquired, must also be\n\ntaken into consideration in fixing the market value and the deduction of\n\ndevelopment charges.     Further, in paragraph 30, the Court specifically\n\nreferred to the deduction for the development charges and observed:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">            \"30.   We are not, however, oblivious of the fact that normally\n                   1/3rd deduction of further amount of compensation has\n                   been directed in some cases. However, the purpose for\n                   which the land is acquired must also be taken into\n                   consideration.    In the instant case, the land was\n                   acquired for the construction of new BG line for the\n                   Konkan Railways...................... In the instant case,\n                   acquisition is for laying a railway line. Therefore, the\n                   question of development thereof would not arise.\"</blockquote><p id=\"p_11\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">      The Court made a reference to two other cases, viz., Hasanali\n\nKhanbhai &amp; Sons Vs. State of Gujarat and Land Acquisition Officer\n\nVs. Nookala Rajamallu reported in 1995 (5) SCC 422 and 2003(12) SCC\n\n334 respectively, where, the deduction by way development charges, was\n\nheld permissible. The situation is no different in the present case. All that\n\nthe acquiring body has to achieve is to widen the National Highway. There\n\nis no further question of any development. We again, even at the cost of\n\nrepetition, reiterate that no evidence was shown before us in support of the\n\nplea of the proposed development. We, therefore, hold that the High Court\n\nhas erred in directing the deduction on account of the developmental\n\ncharges at the rate of Rs.25/- per square feet out of the ordered\n\ncompensation at the rate of Rs.75/- per square feet. We set aside the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                   7</span>\n\njudgment to that extent. The claimant would, therefore, be entitled to the\n\ncompensation at the rate of Rs.75/- per square feet with all the statutory\n\nbenefits like solatium under <a href=\"/doc/55378/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 23(2)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/132249/\" id=\"a_6\">12</a>% interest under <a href=\"/doc/955646/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 23</a>\n\n(1-A) on the enhanced market value and interest at 9% and 15% as\n\nprovided under <a href=\"/doc/1379589/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 34</a> of the Act for one year and the rest of the period\n\nfrom the date of taking possession till the date of payment of the\n\ncompensation awarded in favour of the claimant. With this, we partly allow\n\nthe appeal and modify the order of the High Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">                                            ......................................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">                                            (Tarun Chatterjee)\n\n\n\n                                             ......................................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">                                            (V.S.

Leave granted.\n</p><p id=\"p_4\">\f2.    Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the\n\nPunjab and Haryana High Court upholding the conviction of the appellant\n\nfor offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 302</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in\n\nshort the `<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a>') and sentencing him to imprisonment for life and fine of\n\nRs.2,000/- with default stipulation as recorded by learned District and\n\nSessions Judge, Ferozepur.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">3.    Background facts in a nutshell are as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">      A complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 302</a> IPC was filed by Harbans Singh son\n\nof Gurbachan Singh, resident of Chak Saidoke, Police Station Sadar\n\nJallalabad, Tehsil Fazilka against Joginder Singh stating therein that on\n\n18.1.1993 at about 9.00 AM. complainant, his brother Harjinder Singh alias\n\nInder Singh, Sube Singh son of Partap Singh, Jarnail Singh son of Mukhtiar\n\nSingh, Pohla Singh son of Aroor Singh all residents of village Chak Saidoke\n\nhad gone to the school of the village for the purpose of casting their votes in\n\nthe Panchayat Election. At about 9.45 or 10.00 a.m. he and his brother\n\nHarjinder Singh made a request to the voters to keep peace so that there may\n\nnot be any dispute in casting their votes for the people, who were already\n\nstanding in queue to cast their votes. In the meantime, Constable Joginder\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                     2</span>\n\fSingh No. 1421, PC Branch, office of the Senior Superintendent of Police,\n\nFerozepur, (the accused-appellant) challenged his brother Harjinder Singh\n\nand abused him and subsequently, he fired a shot from his rifle. The shot\n\nfired at Harjinder Singh hit on his head and he died at the spot. The\n\noccurrence was witnessed by the complainant along with Sube Singh son of\n\nPartap Singh, Jarnail Singh son of Mukhtiar Singh and Pohla Singh son of\n\nAroor Singh, all residents of village Chak Saidoke. Joginder Singh was\n\nrequested not to fire the shot, but he did not pay any attention and\n\ncommitted the murder of Harjinder Singh. He lodged a report with Inspector\n\nHarbans Lal, who recorded his statement and a case was registered vide FIR\n\nNo.5 dated 18.1.1993 under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_4\">section 304</a> IPC, but he was not arrested by the\n\npolice and no action was taken against him, notwithstanding the fact that he\n\nvisited the Police Station on number of times and this necessitated the filing\n\nof complaint.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">      The inquest report on the dead body of Harjinder Singh was prepared\n\nby Inspector Harbans Lal and he sent the dead body of Harjinder Singh to\n\nCivil Hospital, Fazilka, where post mortem on the dead body of Harjinder\n\nSingh was conducted. As per the post mortem report, cause of death was\n\ndue to shock and haemorrhage as a result of injuries Nos.1 and 2, which\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                     3</span>\n\fwere on the vital part of the brain and were sufficient to cause death in the\n\nordinary course of nature and the injuries were caused with fire-arms.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">       After investigation was completed, charge sheet was filed. Since the\n\nappellant abjured guilt, trial was held.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">      Stand of the accused appellant before the trial Court apart from the\n\nplea of denial was that some people tried to snatch away ballot boxes as a\n\nconsequence of which the law and order situation became bad. The police\n\nparty fired in the air to disburse the mob. The trial Court placing reliance on\n\nthe evidence of the eye witnesses recorded the conviction as noted above.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">      In appeal the primary stand was that the so called eye witnesses were\n\nrelated to the deceased and, therefore, their evidence should not have been\n\nrelied upon. The High Court found that merely because the prime witnesses\n\nwere related to the deceased that did not in any event affect the credibility of\n\ntheir evidence. It was submitted that only one shot was fired and, therefore,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 302</a> IPC has no application. It was also noted that there was no\n\nevidence that the voters had become uncontrollable or that there was\n\nsnatching of ballot boxes or ballot papers. The evidence clearly established\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                      4</span>\n\fthat the accused aimed at the head of the deceased and fired the shot.\n\nAccordingly, the High Court dismissed the appeal.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">4.    The stand taken before the High Court was re-iterated by learned\n\ncounsel for the appellant in this appeal.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_17\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">5.    Learned counsel for the State on the other hand supported the\n\njudgment of the trial Court as affirmed by the High Court.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">6.    Merely because the eye-witnesses are family members, their evidence\n\ncannot `per se' be discarded. When there is allegation of interestedness, the\n\nsame has to be established. Mere statement that being relatives of the\n\ndeceased they are likely to falsely implicate the accused cannot be a ground\n\nto discard the evidence which is otherwise cogent and credible. We shall\n\nalso deal with the contention regarding interestedness of the witnesses for\n\nfurthering the prosecution version. Relationship is not a factor to affect\n\ncredibility of a witness. It is more often than not that a relation would not\n\nconceal actual culprit and make allegations against an innocent person.\n\nFoundation has to be laid if plea of false implication is made. In such cases,\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                     5</span>\n\fthe court has to adopt a careful approach and analyse evidence to find out\n\nwhether it is cogent and credible.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_20\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">7.    <a href=\"/doc/1487227/\" id=\"a_6\">In Dalip Singh and Ors. v. The State of Punjab</a> (AIR 1953 SC 364) it\n\nhas been laid down as under:-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_22\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">             \"A witness is normally to be considered independent\n             unless he or she springs from sources which are likely to\n             be tainted and that usually means unless the witness has\n             cause, such as enmity against the accused, to wish to\n             implicate him falsely. Ordinarily a close relation would\n             be the last to screen the real culprit and falsely implicate\n             an innocent person. It is true, when feelings run high\n             and there is personal cause for enmity, that there is a\n             tendency to drag in an innocent person against whom a\n             witness has a grudge along with the guilty, but\n             foundation must be laid for such a criticism and the\n             mere fact of relationship far from being a foundation is\n             often a sure guarantee of truth. However, we are not\n             attempting any sweeping generalization. Each case must\n             be judged on its own facts. Our observations are only\n             made to combat what is so often put forward in cases\n             before us as a general rule of prudence. There is no such\n             general rule. Each case must be limited to and be\n             governed by its own facts.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_23\">8.    The above decision has since been followed in <a href=\"/doc/674898/\" id=\"a_7\">Guli Chand and Ors.\n\nv. State of Rajasthan</a> (1974 (3) SCC 698) in which <a href=\"/doc/406841/\" id=\"a_8\">Vadivelu Thevar v. State\n\nof Madras</a> (AIR 1957 SC 614) was also relied upon.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_24\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                     6</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_25\">\f9.    We may also observe that the ground that the witness being a close\n\nrelative and consequently being a partisan witness, should not be relied\n\nupon, has no substance. This theory was repelled by this Court as early as\n\nin Dalip Singh's case (supra) in which surprise was expressed over the\n\nimpression which prevailed in the minds of the Members of the Bar that\n\nrelatives were not independent witnesses. Speaking through Vivian Bose, J.\n\nit was observed:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">             \"We are unable to agree with the learned Judges of the\n             High Court that the testimony of the two eyewitnesses\n             requires corroboration. If the foundation for such an\n             observation is based on the fact that the witnesses are\n             women and that the fate of seven men hangs on their\n             testimony, we know of no such rule. If it is grounded on\n             the reason that they are closely related to the deceased\n             we are unable to concur. This is a fallacy common to\n             many criminal cases and one which another Bench of\n             this Court endeavoured to dispel in - `<a href=\"/doc/1420504/\" id=\"a_9\">Rameshwar v.\n             State of Rajasthan</a>' (AIR 1952 SC 54 at p.59). We find,\n             however, that it unfortunately still persists, if not in the\n             judgments of the Courts, at any rate in the arguments of\n             counsel.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p_26\">10.   Again in <a href=\"/doc/32790580/\" id=\"a_10\">Masalti and Ors. v. State of U.P</a>. (AIR 1965 SC 202) this\n\nCourt observed: (p. 209-210 para 14):\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_27\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">             \"But it would, we think, be unreasonable to contend that\n             evidence given by witnesses should be discarded only\n             on the ground that it is evidence of partisan or interested\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                     7</span>\n\f             witnesses.......The mechanical rejection of such evidence\n             on the sole ground that it is partisan would invariably\n             lead to failure of justice. No hard and fast rule can be\n             laid down as to how much evidence should be\n             appreciated. Judicial approach has to be cautious in\n             dealing with such evidence; but the plea that such\n             evidence should be rejected because it is partisan cannot\n             be accepted as correct.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_28\">11.   To the same effect is the decisions in <a href=\"/doc/313314/\" id=\"a_11\">State of Punjab v. Jagir Singh</a>\n\n(AIR 1973 SC 2407), <a href=\"/doc/1829378/\" id=\"a_12\">Lehna v. State of Haryana</a> (2002 (3) SCC 76) and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/137587/\" id=\"a_13\">Gangadhar Behera and Ors. v. State of Orissa</a> (2002 (8) SCC 381).\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_29\">12.   The above position was also highlighted in <a href=\"/doc/1033267/\" id=\"a_14\">Babulal Bhagwan\n\nKhandare and Anr. v. State of Maharashtra</a> [2005(10) SCC 404], <a href=\"/doc/1429015/\" id=\"a_15\">Salim\n\nSaheb v. State of M.P</a>. (2007(1) SCC 699) and Sonelal v. State of M.P.\n\n(SLP (Crl.) No.3220 of 2007 disposed of on 22.7.2008).\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_30\">13.   In this case though one pellet was recovered and there was only one\n\ninjury. But that does not on the facts of the case take the offence out of the\n\npurview of <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 302</a> IPC. It cannot be laid down as a rule of universal\n\napplication that when there is one shot fired, <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 302</a> IPC is ruled out. It\n\nwould depend upon the factual scenario, more particularly, the nature of\n\nweapon, the place where the injury is caused and the nature of the injury.

Challenge in these appeals is to the judgment of a Division Bench of\n\nthe Allahabad High Court directing acquittal of the respondents. By the\n\nimpugned judgment two appeals were disposed of. The appellant-accused\n\nin each case had questioned correctness of the judgment rendered by learned\n\n9th Additional Sessions Judge, Kanpur in ST Case Nos. 190 of 1979 and 212\n\nof 1979. Each was convicted for offence punishable under Section 302 read\n\nwith Section 34 and Section 323 read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 34</a> of the Indian Penal\n\fCode,     1860 (in short the `<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a>') respectively. Additionally, accused\n\nSurender was convicted for offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 354</a> IPC.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_4\">2.      Prosecution version as unfolded during trial is as follows:\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">        In the evening of 20.3.1979 at about 6.00 pm Km. Sharmi (PW 4) was\n\ngoing to attend the call of nature. She was moving few steps ahead of Km.\n\nMunni. It is alleged that at the relevant moment Surendra and Suresh\n\naccosted Km. Sharmi. They told her to accompany them into Arhar field and\n\nwith that intent they also held her hands. On the alarm raised by her Km.\n\nMunni rushed to her rescue. At this, both the accused persons took to their\n\nheels. On her return to the house, Km Sharmi (P.W.4) narrated the incident\n\nto her maternal uncle Krishanapal, the deceased in the incident, and\n\nVijaypal (P.W.3). Both the brothers, went to the house of accused Sheo Lal,\n\nand made a complaint about the shameful behavior of his son and nephew.\n\nHaving made the complaint they came back to their house.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">         The deceased, Krishnapal, and his brother Vijayapal were relaxing\n\nand smoking Bidis on the Chabutara, which abuts their house. A burning\n\nlantern was also hanging near the grass-cutting machine. A lamp was also\n\nburning at the main door of the house.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                      2</span>\n\f      At about 8.00 P.M. Sheo Lal accompanied by Suresh and Surendra\n\ncame to the house of Krishanapal, deceased. Sheo Lal and Suresh were\n\narmed with Lathis and Surendra was armed with a knife. Immediately on\n\ntheir arrival near the deceased, they started hurling abuses and said that\n\nsince they are maligning his family, inflicted lathi injuries upon the\n\ndeceased and Surendra attacked him with knife. The hue and cry raised by\n\nthe deceased attracted Ratipal (P.W1), Chandrapal (P.W.2), Km. Sharmi\n\n(P.W.4) and some other family members to the spot. Ratipal was also\n\npossessing a torch in his hand. Chandrapal was also attacked with lathis\n\nwhen he tried to intercede. He had sustained lathi injuries. As a result of the\n\ninjuries sustained, Krishanapal fell down and died instantaneously. The\n\naccused persons withdrew thereafter.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">      The F.I.R. of the incident was lodged by Vijaypal (P.W.3). The\n\nwritten report is Ext. Ka.l. It was scribed by Rampal and was lodged at P.S.\n\nBidhnoo at 11.15 P.M. He was accompanied to the police station by\n\nRatipal, Chandrapal and Rampal. The chick is Ext. Ka. 2. It was prepared\n\nby P.W. Lallan Singh, Head Moharir.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                     3</span>\n\f       Chandrapal (P.W.2) was sent from the police station to the Primary\n\nHealth Center, Bidhnoo for medical examination of his injuries. He was\n\nescorted by constable Mahipal (P.W.5), for that purpose.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">      After completion of investigation charge sheet was filed. As the\n\naccused persons pleaded innocence trial was held. The trial court recorded\n\nconviction. As noted above separate appeals were filed by each one of the\n\naccused persons which were disposed of by the common judgment directing\n\ntheir acquittal. The stand of the accused appellant before the High Court\n\nwas that the motive suggested is clearly unacceptable as the parties are\n\ninter-se related and it is improbable that the accused persons will tried to\n\nmolest their cousin (PW 4) in the manner as alleged by the prosecution. It\n\nwas submitted that the incident has not occurred in the manner alleged and\n\nthe FIR was ante dated. The trial court placed reliance on the evidence of\n\nfour eye witnesses PW 1 to PW4. The High Court noted that so far as the\n\nmotive is concerned the only witness is PW 4. The High Court accepted the\n\ndefence version that the motive was not established and the accusations\n\nwere also not established. Accordingly, it directed acquittal.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                     4</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">\f3.    In support of the appeals, learned counsel for the appellant submitted\n\nthat the conclusions of the High Court are absolutely unsustainable. What\n\nappears to have weighed with the High Court to doubt versity of\n\nprosecution version is the introduction of a witness i.e. Munni Devi\n\nregarding the motive. The conclusions are based on presumption and\n\nsurmises. There were contradictory observations and no reason has been\n\nindicated to discard the version of the injured eye witnesses.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">4.    In response, learned counsel for the respondents supported the\n\njudgment of the High Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">5.    One of the prime reasons indicated by the High Court to discard the\n\nprosecution version is that in a dark night the possibility of identification\n\nwas not there. The source of light for identification was not mentioned in\n\nthe FIR. It is significant to note that there were four of the witnesses and\n\nsome of them were injured in the incidence. PW2 was an injured eye\n\nwitness. His evidence has been discarded on the ground that the injury\n\nsustained by him was a typical bruise. The following observations of the\n\nHigh Court show total non application of mind.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                     5</span>\n\f      \"Now we take up the testimony of Chandrapal\n\n(P.W.2), who, according to the prosecution, is an injured\n\nwitness. He has sustained these injuries while trying to\n\nintervene. His injury was examined on 20-3-1979 at\n\n11.30 p.m. His medical examination was conducted by\n\nDr. A.K. Shukla (P.W.8). This witness has sustained\n\nonly a solitary contusion. The injury is 21 cm.x 15 cm.\n\nOn the left side of back crossing the spine upto the right\n\nside at the level of fourth vertebral column. The injury\n\nwas simple and was fresh at the time of medical\n\nexamination. The Doctor has not noted the color of this\n\ninjury. He stated that by writing `fresh' he meant that the\n\ninjury was 2/3 hours old. He has made the entry with\n\nregard to this injury in the out door patients' register.\n\nWhen this doctor was examined in court, the injured was\n\nnot present before him. He has not noted down the depth\n\nof the bruise. He had admitted that these bruises could be\n\nmanaged with a chemical. He had stated in court that the\n\ninjury sustained by injured Chandrapal was a typical\n\nbruise. It was depressed in the middle and the edges were\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                        6</span>\n\f            slightly raised, but when probed further he admitted that\n\n            these facts, were not noted down by him in the injury\n\n            report or any where else.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_17\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">6.    Merely becasuse the colour of the injury was not noted and the doctor\n\nhas written that the injury was fresh, that is no ground to discard his\n\nevidence. The High Court has also attached unnecessary importance to the\n\nfact that one witness stated that the assault continued for 8 to 10 minutes\n\nwhile another said it was around three minutes. The doctor's evidence was\n\ndiscarded on the ground that his testimony was of poor quality and does not\n\ninspire confidence. The injury appeared to be manufactured one. The\n\njudgment is full of contradictions. As stated above, the High Court at one\n\nplace noticed that it is improbable that the accused person who was cousin\n\nof PW 4 tried to molest her. In the same breath the High Court in another\n\nplace has held that the accused persons to molest PW 4 at a particular\n\nmoment took her to the Arhar field and this was done with her prior\n\nconsent. The High Court goes further to say that there was no planning in\n\nthe act and had appeared to be chance meeting which led to it. The absurdity\n\nof the High Court's conclusions can be gauged from the fact that the High\n\nCourt found it unnatural that two girls of almost of the same age group were\n\nwalking and as to why one of them would move ahead and the other would\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                    7</span>\n\fcome behind is unnatural. The High Court further has held that PW 3 stated\n\nin Court that PW4 on her return told him that accused persons has teased\n\nher in the field. The High Court found fault with the statement on the\n\nground that he did not tell before the police that the girl did not tell PW 3\n\nthat the accused persons held her hands.         So far as the High Court's\n\nconclusions that there was non-mention of the source of light in the FIR it\n\nneeds to be noted that the accused persons were not strangers to the\n\nwitnesses. They were closely related.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_19\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">7.    <a href=\"/doc/1928406/\" id=\"a_4\">In Nathuni Yadav v. State of Bihar</a> [1998(9) SCC 238] this Court\n\nobserved that under what circumstances the lack of moonlight or artificial\n\nlight does not per se preclude identification of the assailants. It was noted as\n\nfollows: (SCC p. 242, para 9)\n\n                 \"Even assuming that there was no moonlight then, we have\n             to gauge the situation carefully. The proximity at which the\n             assailants would have confronted with the injured, the\n             possibility of some light reaching there from the glow of stars,\n             and the fact that the murder was committed on a roofless\n             terrace are germane factors to be borne in mind while judging\n             whether the victims could have had enough visibility to\n             correctly identify the assailants. Over and above those factors,\n             we must bear in mind the further fact that the assailants were\n             no strangers to the inmates of the tragedy-bound house, the\n             eyewitnesses being well acquainted with the physiognomy of\n             each one of the killers. We are, therefore, not persuaded to\n             assume that it would not have been possible for the victims to\n             see the assailants or that there was possibility for making a\n             wrong identification of them. We are keeping in mind the fact\n             that even the assailants had enough light to identify the victims\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                      8</span>\n\f            whom they targeted without any mistake from among those\n            who were sleeping on the terrace. If the light then available,\n            though meagre, was enough for the assailants why should we\n            think that the same light was not enough for the injured who\n            would certainly have pointedly focussed their eyes on the faces\n            of the intruders standing in front of them. What is sauce for the\n            goose is sauce for the gander.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_21\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">8.    The position was reiterated in <a href=\"/doc/415969/\" id=\"a_5\">Bharosi v. State of M.P</a>. [2002(7) SCC\n\n239] and <a href=\"/doc/510098/\" id=\"a_6\">S. Sudershan Reddy v. State of A.P</a>. [2006(10) SCC 163].\n\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">9.    The High Court's judgment therefore is clearly unsustainable and is\n\nset aside. The judgment of the trial court is restored. The respondents shall\n\nsurrender to custody forthwith to serve the remainder of sentence.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_24\">10.

State of Punjab has questioned the correctness of the judgment\n\nrendered by a Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court\n\ndirecting acquittal of the respondents. Each of the respondents was found\n\nguilty of offences punishable under Sections 302,450,324,148 read with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 149</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the `<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a>'). Learned\n\fAdditional Sessions Judge Gurdaspur has found the accused guilty and\n\nsentenced them as aforestated.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">2.    Prosecution version in a nutshell is as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">      At about 6 PM on October 31, 1995 Teja Singh (PW2) alongwith his\n\nson Joginder Singh and his daughter-in-law Paramjit Kaur(PW3) was\n\npresent in his haveli in Village china Railwala. His brother Fauja Singh and\n\nhis son Nirmal Singh (PW4) were living in an adjoining house and were\n\npresent therein. Soon thereafter accused Dalbir Singh alias Kala, Mohinder\n\nSingh and Swinder Singh, all armed with knieves, Baljit Singh alias Beeta\n\narmed with Dang, and Jasbir Singh alias Killa, Rachhpal Singh alias Pappu\n\nand Ramjit Singh alias Rana all empty handed came to the spot. Rachhpal\n\nSingh raised a lalkara that the complainant party be taught a lesson for\n\nhaving got Dalbir Singh arrested by giving false information to the police,\n\nRanjit Singh then caught hold of Joginder Singh from his long hair and\n\nDalbir Singh gave two blows with the knife he was carrying. The other\n\naccused also caused injuries to Joginder Singh with their respective\n\nweapons. Nirmal Singh and Paramjit Kaur tried to intervene but they too\n\nsustained injuries caused by the accused.      Fauja Singh raised an alarm\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                        2</span>\n\fhearing which all the accused ran away from the spot. Joginder Singh was\n\nremoved to the Civil Hospital Gurdaspur where he was declared dead\n\nwhereas the two injured eye witnesses, Nirmal Singh and Paramjit Kaur,\n\nwere medico-legality examined. Teja Singh (PW2) also left for the police\n\nstation but came across a police party headed by SI Sukhmohinder Singh\n\n(PW 9) and made his statement to the said officer at 10.55 PM and on its\n\nbasis the FIR was registered at police station, Dhariwal at 11PM. The\n\nspecial report was delivered to the Illaqa Magistrate at Gurdaspur at 7.22\n\nAM, on November 1, 1995. The accused persons were arrested in the course\n\nof the investigation and on its completion, were charged for offences\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_3\">Sections 302</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1982060/\" id=\"a_4\">450</a>, <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_5\">324</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_6\">148</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 149</a> IPC.\n\nThey pleaded not guilty and were brought to trial.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">      In order to establish the accusations prosecution examined eight\n\nwitnesses. Teja Singh, Parmjit Kaur and Nirmal Singh (PWs.2, 3 &amp; 4) were\n\nstated to be eye witnesses and the last two were injured eye witnesses. The\n\ntrial court placed reliance on their version and directed conviction as\n\naforestated.   Accused persons filed an appeal before the High Court.\n\nPrimary stand before the High Court was that there was delay in lodging the\n\nFIR and sending the special report and injuries on the accused were not\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                       3</span>\n\fexplained. It was also submitted that there was no mention in the FIR about\n\nthe injuries caused on Paramjit Kaur.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">      It was pointed out that Kuljit Kaur had sustained injuries inflicted by\n\nKala when she tried to intervene was not mentioned in the FIR. The High\n\nCourt accepted the stand and directed acquittal.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">3.    Learned counsel for the State submitted that the High Court's\n\njudgment is practically non-reasoned.       The trial court had analysed the\n\nevidence and noticed that there was no delay in either lodging the FIR or in\n\ndispatching a special report. Further the trial Court had categorically noted\n\nthat the injuries on the accused were superficial.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">4.    Learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand submitted that\n\nthe whole truth has not been disclosed and therefore the High Court was\n\njustified in directing acquittal. It is submitted that the scope for interference\n\nwith an order of acquittal is very limited and only where the judgment is\n\nperverse or contrary to evidence on record, the appellate court in a given\n\ncase may interfere.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                             4</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">\f5.    It is to be noted that the High Court's judgment is practically non-\n\nreasoned and whatever reasons have been indicated are not only sketchy but\n\nalso are based on surmises and conjectures. There is also no discussion as\n\nto why the conclusions of the trial court have been found to be\n\nunsustainable. It is to be noted that the trial court found categorically that\n\nthere was no delay in lodging or despatching the FIR to Illqua Magistrate\n\nand the injuries on the accused persons were superficial. It is accepted that\n\nno report was lodged with the police about the accused person having\n\nsustained injuries. There is no counter case and interestingly no report\n\nappears to have been sent by the doctor who it was claimed by the accused\n\npersons to have treated the accused for the injuries sustained. The trial\n\ncourt noted that the occurrence took place around 6 PM. There were several\n\ninjured persons who were taken to the hospital. The trial court rightly noted\n\nthat it was but natural for Teja Singh whose son Joginder Singh had\n\nsustained injuries to take him to the hospital to save his life and the life of\n\nParamjit Kaur and Nirmal Singh, instead of going first to the police station.\n\nAll these aspects have not been dealt with by the High Court. There is also\n\nno discussion about evidence of PWs 2 &amp; 4 by the High Court.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                           5</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">\f6.       In the aforesaid background we deem it proper to remit the matter to\n\nHigh Court for a fresh consideration and disposal of the appeal by a\n\nreasoned judgment. Since the matter is pending since long, we request the\n\nHigh court to explore the possibility of early disposal of the matter.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">7.

Leave granted.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">2.    Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a learned Single Judge\n\nof the Madras High Court, Madurai Bench, dismissing the appeal filed by\n\nthe appellant. Appellant was held guilty of offence punishable under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 304</a> Part II of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the `<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a>') and\n\nsentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for seven years by learned\n\nPrincipal Judge, Dindigul.\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">\f3.    The factual position need not be gone into in detail in view of order\n\nproposed to be passed.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">4.    The accused faced trial for alleged commission of offence punishable\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 302</a> IPC. It was the prosecution version that in the course of\n\nsudden quarrel, the accused attacked Lakshmi (hereinafter referred to as the\n\n'deceased') who was stated to be the second wife of one Samuvel. On\n\n10.12.1994 the occurrence occurred. The accused faced trial and as noted\n\nabove was convicted by the trial court. The appeal before the High Court\n\nwas admitted considering the various grounds of challenge raised by the\n\nappellant. It appears from the impugned order of the High Court that the\n\nappellant's counsel did not appear when the matter was taken up and after\n\nhearing learned Additional Prosecutor, the appeal was disposed of.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">5.    It was pointed out learned counsel for the appellant that because of\n\nvarious difficulties the appellant's counsel could not appear and more\n\nparticularly neither the appellant nor his counsel had any knowledge that the\n\nmatter was to be taken up before the Madurai Bench of the High Court.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                    2</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">\f6.       Learned counsel for the respondent-State on the other hand submitted\n\nthat the appellant and her counsel ought to have been more vigilant.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">7.       While issuing notice on 23.7.2007, it was indicated that the matter\n\nmay be remitted for fresh hearing because the appellant was not represented\n\nwhen the matter was taken up by the Madurai Bench of the Madras High\n\nCourt.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">8.       Considering the difficulties highlighted by the appellant to explain\n\nnon-appearance of the counsel we are satisfied that this is a fit case where\n\nthe High Court should re-hear the matter.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">9.       We have not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case.

The present six appellants were tried for the offences punishable\n\nunder Sections 451, 381 read with 120-B<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_1\"> of the Indian Penal Code</a> and\n\nunder Section 3(3) of TADA (P) Act. These appellants were acquitted of the\n\noffence under T.A.D.A. but they were found guilty of offences under <a href=\"/doc/513777/\" id=\"a_2\">Sections\n\n451</a> and <a href=\"/doc/436339/\" id=\"a_3\">381</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 120-B</a> of I.P.C. On both these counts, they\n\nwere sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of three\n\nyears each and the sentences were ordered to run concurrently.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_2\">             These appellants were employees of Halliburton Offshore\n\nServices Inc.Company. They were carrying out the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                     2</span>\n\ncontract of offshore logging under the O.N.G.C.    There was some dispute\n\nbetween the employees and the management over the transfer of A-1 to\n\nBombay office and the appellants allege that PW 1, who was the Operations\n\nManager of the company, was inimically having disputes towards these\n\naccused. The company was in possession of certain radio active resources\n\nto find out the resource of natural gas.      The allegation against these\n\nappellants is that they have unlawfully trespassed into the workshop of the\n\ncompany and took away three radio active resources and thereby committed\n\nthe offences as charged.     On 23rd September, 1993 these radio active\n\nresources were found missing from the office premises. On 24th September,\n\n1993 PW 1 gave a complaint before the Station House Officer, Maduravayal\n\npolice station. The Sub- Inspector of Police -PW 20 took up the investigation\n\nand these appellants were arrested thereafter. Later on the investigation was\n\nhanded over to the C.B.C.I.D. and PW 26-Inspector of Police took over the\n\ninvestigation and he filed a report before the Court invoking the provisions\n\nof the TADA Act. The Superintendent of Police recorded the confessional\n\nstatement the appellants 2,3 and 4 and pursuant to the confessions, certain\n\nrecoveries were also effected and the three radio active resources were\n\nrecovered and later on the final report was filed in the case. On behalf of\n\nthe prosecution, 26 witnesses have been examined.       The appellants were\n\nfound guilty on the basis of their confessions and also the recovery made\n\npursuant to the statements made by the accused.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_3\">            Heard both sides.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">\n\n            Learned counsel for the appellants contended that the materials\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                        3</span>\n\nadduced by the prosecution are not sufficient to find the appellants guilty.\n\nWe do not find any force in the contention and the Designated Judge was\n\njustified in holding that the appellants had committed the offence and\n\ntherefore, we confirm the conviction.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">            Though the articles so stolen were of serious nature but there is\n\nno case that these appellants had any ulterior motive except to cause some\n\nnuisance to the employer. It appears that due to transfer of A-1 to Bombay\n\nthey had some grievance against the management.            There is also no\n\nevidence to show that these appellants had stored the articles for the\n\npurpose of gaining any financial benefit nor did they make any attempt to\n\nsell away these articles to some others. We are told that the appellants have\n\nalready undergone the sentence for more than 1 year and 9 months. Having\n\nregard to the facts and circumstances of the case, we feel that the period of\n\nimprisonment already undergone by the appellants is sufficient to meet the\n\nends of justice.   Therefore, we confirm the conviction but reduce the\n\nsentence to the period already undergone.

Leave granted.\n</p><p id=\"p_4\">\f2.    Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the\n\nMadras High Court dismissing several Writ Petitions and Writ Appeals\n\nincluding Writ Petition Nos.18618/2003 to 18621/2003.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">3.    The short question which arises for determination in this Civil Appeal\n\nconcerns challenge to the Constitutional validity of Tamil Nadu Motor\n\nVehicles Taxation (Amendment) Act, 1998, by which initially the rate of tax\n\nin respect of contract carriage stood increased from Rs.1500/- per seat per\n\nquarter to Rs.2000/- per seat per quarter, and subsequently the said rate\n\nstood enhanced from Rs.2000/- per seat per quarter to Rs.3000/- per seat per\n\nquarter vide Notification No.1184 dated 30.11.2001 with effect from 1st\n\nDecember 2001.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">4.    The basis of the challenge rests on the uneven burden placed on the\n\nowners of contract carriage vis-a-vis stage carriage. Broadly it is contended\n\nthat there is no rational in the imposition of the levy, that tax is imposed\n\nindiscriminately, that it is levied to cross-subsidize stage carriage and that\n\nuneven burden has been placed on the owners of contract carriage which\n\nhas no nexus with the services or amenities provided.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                     2</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">\f5.      Generally, in a matter of this nature, the quantifiable data forms the\n\nbasis of the challenge. At the initial stage when the petition is filed in such\n\ncases there has got to be a precise formulation of the ground of challenge\n\nfrom the side of the appellant based on some statistical data as to\n\ndisproportionality of the rate of tax. It is only thereafter that the burden will\n\nshift on to the State to submit quantifiable and measurable data.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">6.        In the present case we find that the initial burden on the appellant\n\nitself has not been discharged in the sense that the petitions filed before the\n\nHigh Court were very sketchy. A challenge of this nature requires the\n\nappellant to furnish greater details before the State could be called upon to\n\nsubmit quantifiable and measurable data justifying the impugned rate.\n\nUltimately, it is the State which has to meet the allegations made in the writ\n\npetitions and if those allegations made in the writ petitions are vague,\n\ninaccurate or insufficient then it would not be possible for the State to\n\nsubmit its reply/data to the Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">7.       One more aspect in these cases also needs to be mentioned. It has\n\nbeen argued before us that the tax in question is a compensatory tax. Certain\n\njudgments of this Court are also relied upon in this regard, the latest being\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                      3</span>\n\fthe judgment in the case of Jindal Stainless Ltd. (2) and <a href=\"/doc/1937475/\" id=\"a_1\">Another vs. State of\n\nHaryana and Others</a> [(2006) 7 SCC 241].\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">8.          In our view, this repeated increase in the rate of tax, particularly the\n\nincidence of which is more on the contract carriage vis-`-vis. stage carriage\n\nraises question of public importance. At the same time the State can\n\ncertainly rely upon the data available to show cross subsidization, if it so\n\nexists in a given case, by which stage carriage gets subsidized in public\n\ninterest.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">9.          Keeping in mind the gamut of the dispute involved, we are of the\n\nview that the impugned judgment of the High Court cannot be interfered\n\nwith, particularly when the pleadings at the initial stage were insufficient.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">10.    Realizing this difficulty, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nappellant fairly stated that he would seek permission of this Court to\n\nwithdraw the Civil Appeal with liberty to file proper writ petition in the\n\nHigh Court giving requisite details and available data. Normally, we would\n\nnot have granted such permission. However, as stated above, questions of\n\npublic importance arises in these matters, particularly in the context of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                         4</span>\n\fprinciples of proportionality under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution and the\n\nlater development of law as indicated by this Court in the case of Jindal\n\nStainless Ltd. (Supra).\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_17\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">11.   In the circumstances we permit the appellant herein to withdraw the\n\nCivil Appeal with liberty to file proper writ petition, if so advised. We make\n\nit clear that we do not find any infirmity in the impugned judgment of the\n\nHigh Court which is based on the petition originally filed by the petitioners.\n\nSubject to above, Civil Appeal stands dismissed with no order as to costs.\n\nWe make it clear that if a proper writ petition is filed giving requisite data to\n\nthe satisfaction of the High Court, then any observation made in the\n\nimpugned judgment will not come in the way of the appellant. All\n\ncontentions of both sides are expressly kept open.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">12.    Similar order was passed in a group of cases i.e. <a href=\"/doc/975119/\" id=\"a_3\">Tamil Nadu Omni\n\nBus Owners Association v. State of Tamil Nadu &amp; Anr</a>.( i.e. Civil Appeal\n\nNo.1177 of 2006 etc. disposed of on 28.11.2007).\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_20\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                      5</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">\f13.

Ragging in educational institutions has been a matter of concern for\n\nthis Court since long. Noticing that notwithstanding a judgment of this\n\nCourt in Vishwa Jagriti Mission through <a href=\"/doc/40503/\" id=\"a_1\">President v. Central Government</a>\n\nthrough Cabinet Secretary &amp; Ors. (AIR 2001 SC 2793) few remedial\n\npractical measures have been taken to prevent the menace of ragging in\n\feducational institutions, by order dated 27.11.2006, a Committee was\n\nconstituted under the chairmanship of Mr. R.K. Raghvan, Ex-Director,\n\nC.B.I.    The Committee has submitted its report and suggested certain\n\nmeasures. Subsequently orders dated 16.5.2007 and 10.12.2007 were\n\npassed.    Further Status report has been submitted by Shri Gopal\n\nSubramanium, learned Amicus Curiae. Pursuant to the directions given by\n\nthis Court, the second and third reports of the Committee have been filed\n\nwhich read as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">            \"SECOND REPORT: The Committee under the chairmanship\n            of Dr RK Raghavan met at New Delhi on the 2nd April 2008 to\n            take stock of the situation and review the progress made by\n            different authorities, agencies and other stake holders who had\n            been directed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court to implement the\n            recommendations of this Committee's Report on ragging and\n            also of the Lyngdoh Committee on elections to student unions.</blockquote><p id=\"p_7\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">            2.     On the 10th December, 2007 the Supreme Court had\n            heard the matter and had passed certain orders. Accordingly,\n            on 4-1-2008, the Ministry conveyed to all the regulatory\n            institutions like UGC, AICTE, MCI, DCI, PCI, INC and ICAR,\n            the observations of the Court and its directions that in the\n            prospectus of the higher educational institutions it should be\n            mentioned that if any incident of ragging comes to the notice of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                   2</span>\n\fthe authority concerned, the accused student will be given\nopportunity to explain and if his explanation is not satisfactory\nthe authority would expel him from the institution. The\nregulatory institutions were also requested to intimate from\ntime to time the progress being made and were also informed\nthat the reports being received from individual higher\neducational institutions be consolidated and analysed and only\nthe findings intimated to the Ministry for placing before the\nCommittee. For arousing public consciousness against ragging,\naudio video jingles/spots have been prepared by the Ministry\nwith the assistance of DAVP for release in the media. The\nCBSE has issued a letter to all institutions affiliated to it for\nimplementing an effective programme of counseling for\nstudents involving both parents and teachers, abolishing\ncorporal punishment, creating awareness about human rights\nand indicating the students behaviour pattern in the school\nleaving and character certificates. The Committee reviewed the\nprogress reported by the UGC, MCI and DCI. The absence of\nany report from NCI was noted. Thereafter the Committee also\nheard from the representative of UGC, AICTE, MCI and DCI\nthe measures taken and progress achieved by them.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">3.    The MCI informed that of the total 270 medical colleges\nin the country, 202 had reported the various measures taken.\nThese have constituted anti-ragging committees. They have\npublished names and telephone numbers of officials to be\ncontacted by freshers in case of ragging.       They have also\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                        3</span>\n\fconducted counselling sessions and orientation courses for\nsenior and fresh students. Punishments have been given to\nstudents found guilty of ragging, and the number of institutions\nreporting compliance has increased due to the efforts of the\nCouncil. The Dental Council of India also detailed the steps\nbeing taken to prevent ragging. Its representative said that all\nthe 127 dental colleges in India had constituted anti-ragging\ncommittees and squads to check ragging. These institutions\nhave reported compliance with publication of telephone\nnumbers and names of officials to be contacted in case of\nragging, besides conducting counselling and orientation\ncourses for seniors and juniors.       The AICTE's Member\nSecretary informed that the Council had issued advertisements\ninforming the higher technical educational institutions of the\ndirectives of the Supreme Court and had warned of deterrent\npunishment to institutions, like reduction in number of seats. If\nragging still took place in the institution. He said that the\nindividual compliance report received from each institution has\nbeen sent to the Ministry and that a significant reduction as\ncompared to last year in the number of cases of ragging has\nbeen achieved. He said that efforts were continuing and that it\nis hoped that incidents of ragging would be further reduced in\nthe new academic year.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">4.    Two cases of victimization of students who complained\nabout ragging had come to the notice of the Chairman who\npromptly took up the matter with the concerned institution,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                         4</span>\n\fviz., Dr. MGR Educational &amp; Research Institute, Chennai (a\ndeemed university). It was only after two months, the Institute\ngave a reply. The two students have refuted the allegations\nmade against them in the Institute's reply. The Committee feels\nthat the whole episode needs to be probed in detail by the\nAICTE and a report obtained for further action.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">5.    The Committee noted that regarding student union\nelections the Secretary, Higher Education Department has\naddressed on 29.11.07 the State Chief Secretaries, for taking\nnecessary action. It thereafter took the following decisions:\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">      (a)    the cases of harassment of two students for\n      complaining about ragging referred to by Chairman be\n      sent to the UGC for further action and this be mentioned\n      in the report to the Apex Court.

This may be mentioned in the report to the Apex\n      Court for its orders;\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_17\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                        5</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">\f(c)   regulatory agencies should put up the suggested\nanti-ragging measures before their council and get\napproval;\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_19\">\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">(d)   the MCI should prepare draft regulation to prevent\nragging and send it to the Ministry for fast-tracking its\nadoption;\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_21\">\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">(e)   where medical colleges and dental colleges are\nhaving same facilities/ campuses          the Councils\nconcerned should make combined efforts to be more\neffective;\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_23\">\n</p><p id=\"p_24\">(f)   since the XI Plan Funding Committees of the UGC\nwill be visiting educational institutions to assess the\ngrant requirements and invite proposals, prevention of\nragging be made one of the focus items.

In both the meetings the Committee reviewed the actions\ntaken on the decisions of the Committee's previous meetings.\nIn the meeting held on 11th June 2008 the Committee expressed\nits disappointment over the helplessness shown by the\nregulatory bodies. It suggested to UGC to link release of grants\nunder various schemes to educational institutions with the\ncompliance by them with the directions of the Supreme Court\nof India. It directed educational institutions (through the\nregulatory agencies) to incorporate in their admission\nnotices/advertisements appropriate messages regarding `zero\ntolerence' towards ragging.    It decided that an audio video\ncampaign to prevent ragging should be undertaken at the\ncommencement of the new academic session. It noted that the\nMedical Council of India had not framed draft regulations to\nprevent ragging despite the Committee's advice. The request\nwas reiterated to the Council. It also requested the UGC to\ninvestigate the case of harassment of two students who\ncomplained about ragging, by the MGR Institute of Higher\nEducation &amp; Research. In its meeting held on 5th August 2008\nthe Committee noted that the advertisement and audio visual\ncampaign being undertaken by the Government of India at the\ncommencement of the new academic session to prevent ragging\nin higher educational institutions had good effect.           It\nappreciated that the advertisements of the Ministry have been\nexhibited in the Ministry's website for use by educational\ninstitutions in their local campaigns.   It also noted that in\naddition the Delhi Police had issued advertisements in the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                       8</span>\n\fnational capital region to prevent ragging and the need to\nprevent ragging was rieterated in the State Education\nMinisters' Conference held on 23rd and 24th July 2008 in the\ncapital. The Committee felt that the publicity effort must\npercolate to the institutional level and each campus should\nmake efforts to publicize and sensitize students regarding the\nmenace of ragging.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_37\">\n</p><p id=\"p_38\">3.    In its meeting held on 5th August 2008, the Committee\n\ndiscussed the work being done by several NGOs. Their work\n\nwas appreciated. The video on the website of CURE was\n\nspecially mentioned in addition to the compilation of data\n\nregarding ragging cases reported in various parts of the\n\ncountry. The NGO from West Bengal which is engaged in\n\nprevention of ragging was also referred to. The various\n\ncouncils were advised by the Committee to draw upon the\n\nefforts of NGOs where necessary.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_39\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_40\">4.    The Committee felt that the audiovisual campaign has\n\nbeen successful in raising the level of awareness of the people\n\nabout the evil effects of ragging. The Committee felt that the\n\nadvertisements campaign should be continued to cover the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                       9</span>\n\fcommencement of professional courses. In the case of shortage\n\nof funds the campaign can be focused on medical colleges in\n\nregions more prone to ragging incidents.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_41\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_42\">5.    Reviewing the number of cases reported in the current\n\nacademic session the Committee decided that the case of\n\nragging in the Rajkumari Amrit Kaur College of Nursing, New\n\nDelhi should be enquired into by the Nursing Council of India.\n\nThe Committee resolved that any incident as reported in the\n\npress should be presumed to be ragging unless on enquiry it is\n\nfound to be otherwise. The incidents of ragging reported are\n\npassed off as altercation or spats between students and this\n\nprecludes detailed enquiry and punishment of the guilty\n\nstudents. It therefore desired that the reported incidents should\n\nbe enquired into by the Nursing Council to ascertain the facts\n\nthereof. The Committee noted the ragging case reported at The\n\nGraphic Era Institute of Technology, UP. The AICTE was\n\nrequested to look into the matter to ascertain the facts regarding\n\nthe punishment given to the guilty students. The case of \"paid\n\nragging\" in Coimbatore reported in The Indian Express of\n\n5.8.2008, where the fresh students were forced to pay for the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                        10</span>\n\fluxury trips of senior students in star hotels was referred to the\n\nAICTE for investigation and necessary action. The Committee\n\nemphasized the need to give exemplary punishment as directed\n\nby the Supreme Court to the students found guilty of ragging so\n\nthat the seriousness with which authorities view such incidents\n\nsink in.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_43\">\n</p><p id=\"p_44\">6.    Regarding the harassment case of two students by the\nMGR Institute of Higher Education &amp; Research, Chennai the\nCommittee was unhappy to note the slow progress. It directed\nthe UGC to conduct an enquiry by deputing a joint team of\nUGC and AICTE and submit its findings expeditiously.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_45\">7.    The Committee discussed the problems being created by\n\nanonymous complaints, lack of definition of permissible modes\n\nof interaction of senior with junior students and the role of\n\nstudent unions in preventing ragging. The unwillingness of\n\ncomplainants to disclose their identity and details of ragging\n\nincidents and persons involved is posing a big problem in\n\ntaking action.   The Committee felt that ragging is a very\n\ncomplex phenomenon involving social, psychological and\n\nother dimensions. It would not be appropriate to face the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                        11</span>\n\f             problem from the angle of regulations and restrictions alone\n\n             because it is very difficult for educational administrators to\n\n             tackle demands of students' self governing institutions.\n\n             Generating awareness amongst students through student unions\n\n             about the bad effects of ragging can be tried as a method.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_46\">             8.    The Committee felt that more was needed to be done by\n\n             regulatory bodies to prevent ragging and the response of\n\n             educational institutions to efforts by the Councils lacked\n\n             promptness.       They should formulate regulations and give\n\n             directions. The Committee felt that the learned Additional\n\n             Solicitor General be requested to approach the Hon'ble Court\n\n             on the various other suggestions like dedicated wardens etc.,\n\n             contained in the Committee's report.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_47\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_48\">3.    Ragging is rationalised and justified as a way of \"Introduction or\n\ngetting familiar\" with the freshers at the starting of an academic session of\n\nany educational institution.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_49\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                      12</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_50\">\f4.    In a very positive aspect, \"Ragging\" could not be considered as an\n\nabridgement between the seniors and the freshers, whereas \"Introduction\"\n\ncould be considered as genesis of relationship between the two.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_51\">5.     When any student is admitted in a particular institution he/she has\n\nto face certain problems and one of them which affects the most is staying\n\naway from home and especially away from the dear ones. Because of\n\nthese problems, the freshers expect some one to look after them, with\n\nwhom they can have homely environment as they were enjoying at their\n\nrespective homes. But nowadays the seniors have crossed the barriers, by\n\nwhich they have changed the meaning of \"Introduction\" into \"Ragging\".\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_52\">6.    \"Seniors\" under the garb of \"Introduction\" have started ragging the\n\nfreshers and due to which, in recent years, it has become the talk of the day\n\nthat the freshers who have faced severe ragging are leaving the educational\n\ninstitutions and some have attempted to commit suicide and even some\n\nhave committed it.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_53\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                     13</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_54\">\f7.    In modern era, \"Ragging\" has become to be known only as synonym\n\nof \"teasing\", \"terror\", \"harassment\", \"cruelty\", \"fear\" and \"physical and\n\nmental torture\".\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_55\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_56\">8.    By perusal of records and survey, it has come to be accepted that\n\n\"Ragging\" is a systematized form of Human Rights' abuse as embodied\n\nunder the Constitution of India as well as other Constitutions of the World.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_57\">9.     Over the years in all over the world and especially in South Asia,\n\nthe practice of \"Ragging\" has come to be meant as an extreme\n\n\"harassment\", \"terror\" and even \"physical and mental torture\" of freshers.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_58\">10.    Ragging is a set of undisciplined activities undertaken by the\n\nseniors to break the ice with the juniors, who have been suddenly thrown\n\ninto a totally new environment. The contention of seniors behind all such\n\nactivities is simply to bring the freshers down to earth, because in their\n\nopinion the freshers do not respect the seniors and by doing all such\n\ninhuman activities under the garb of \"Introduction\", the seniors rag the\n\nfreshers so that the freshers may respect them and be under their control.\n\nBut this act cannot be reasonable and just. The act by the seniors is a \"fist\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                    14</span>\n\fof steel against ice\" and likewise by doing so, they shatter the ambition,\n\naim and object of freshers and they become aloof in this practical world.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_59\">11.   To prohibit \"Ragging\", this Cour has given a series of guidelines to\n\nthe educational institutions whether being Central, State or Private Institute.\n\n[See: <a href=\"/doc/301513/\" id=\"a_2\">Vishva Jagriti Mission v. Central Government</a> (AIR 2001 SC 2793)].\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_60\">12.   Ragging in essence is a human rights' abuse. Ragging can be in\n\nvarious forms. It can be physical abuse or mental harassment. In present\n\ntimes shocking incidents of ragging have come to the notice. Sometimes\n\nviolence is used.    The student is physically tortured or psychologically\n\nterrorized. All human being should be free to claim, as a matter of right in\n\nthe society in which they live, for life of dignity but when it is intentionally\n\nor recklessly damaged or departed then the person's human right is abused;\n\nin that sense ragging is the best example of human rights' abuse.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_61\">13.   Everyman's Encyclopaedia (1938 Edition, Vol. II) and Random\n\nHouse Dictionary of the English Language (1967 Edition) have references\n\nabout ragging. The synonyms of ragging as racking, ducking, teasing, etc.\n\nare mentioned in detail in these reference books. In England the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                      15</span>\n\fcredit/discredit goes to Duke of Exeter to introduce the practice of ragging.\n\nRacking was another form of ragging in which a special instrument called\n\n'rack' was used to torture the victim. Gradually it mixed up with the term of\n\nragging. Egyptian, Romans and Greeks were also not lagging behind. Some\n\nform or the other of ragging was found in their societies.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_62\">14.   Ragging is not a new phenomenon. It existed even in older times. It\n\nwas part of civilised societies. In ancient seats of learning, e.g., Berytus and\n\nAthens ragging was prevalent. In army schools of England ragging existed\n\nas a tradition. Later on this tradition took its root in medical and engineering\n\ncolleges. In English society ragging took the form of freshers being paraded\n\non street which caused much annoyance not only to freshers but even to\n\ngeneral public especially girls.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_63\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_64\">15.   Ragging is a form of systematic and sustained physical, mental and\n\nsexual abuse of fresh students at the college/university/any other\n\neducational institution at the hands of senior students of the same institution\n\nand sometimes even by outsiders. Although some form of ragging is present\n\nin every educational institution but serious abuses of human rights take\n\nplace generally in medical and engineering colleges and Armed Forces. The\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                      16</span>\n\fform and effect of ragging differ from institution to institution. It creates a\n\nsense of fear in the minds of first year students and they become\n\napprehensive of unforeseen incidents which later comes true and culminates\n\nin actual form of action.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_65\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_66\">16.   Ragging is \"display of noisy, disorderly conduct and great high spirits\n\nconsidered by perpetrators (raggers) as excellent fun and by many outsiders\n\nas a bloody nuisance\".\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_67\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_68\">17.   Another meaning of ragging is \"to question vigorously and jocularly,\n\nhorseplay or assail roughly and noisily\".\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_69\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_70\">18.   Yet another definition of ragging refers to popular Spanish game of\n\n\"Bull-Fight\", wherein Bull is shown red 'rag' and a person shouts which\n\ninfuriates the Bull in fighting.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_71\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_72\">19.   As noted above \"Ragging\" means display of noisy, disorderly conduct\n\nor doing any act which causes or is likely to cause physical or psychological\n\nharm or raise apprehension or fear or shame or embarrassment to a student\n\nin any educational institution and includes,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                     17</span>\n\f      ( a ) teasing, abusing of, playing practical jokes on, or causing hurt to,\n\n          such students; or\n\n</p><p id=\"p_73\">      (b) asking the student to do any act or perform something which such\n\n          student will not, in the ordinary course, willingly do.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_74\">20.     \"Ragging\" means doing an act which causes or is likely to cause\n\ninsult or annoyance or fear or apprehension or threat or intimidation or\n\noutraging of modesty or injury to a student.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_75\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_76\">21.     \"Ragging\" means causing, inducing, compelling or forcing a student,\n\nwhether by way of a practical joke or otherwise, to do any act which\n\ndetracts from human dignity or violates his person or exposes him to\n\nridicule or to forbear from doing any lawful act, by intimidating, wrongfully\n\nrestraining, wrongfully confining, or injuring him or by using criminal force\n\nto him or by holding out to him any threat of such intimidation, wrongful\n\nrestraint, wrongful confinement, injury or the use of criminal force.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                        18</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_77\">\f22.   The word \"ragging\" colloquially means to tease or play practical\n\njokes on someone, specially on students who are the fresh entrants in the\n\nschools, colleges, Universities or any other educational institutions. In the\n\nbeginning, it was a way of introduction of the first year students in the\n\ninstitutions which gradually has become not only serious problem but also a\n\nsocial stigma. While in the age of a child in cradle, it was a harmless\n\npractice by senior students over their juniors. Regarding the origin or\n\ninitiative steps of the ragging, it can be traced back to the Seventh or Eighth\n\nCentury A.D.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_78\">23.   In 1828-1845, in United States' Colleges and Universities Campus,\n\nseveral student-organizations called 'fraternities' popped up. Freshers to\n\nthese fraternities were known as pledges. In its rudimentary form, it as\n\ncalled 'hazing' which was merely ritual to test the courage of the pledge.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_79\">24.   In ancient Greece, freshers to the sporting communities were\n\nsubjected to humiliation and teasing to inculcate team spirit. After the\n\npassage of time this type of activities were adopted by Armed Forces in\n\nwhich new entrants have to pass out by obeying the seniors in off-duty time.\n\nAs has been said above, in the age of child in cradle, the ragging was a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                     19</span>\n\fharmless practice rather permissible in the society but it had taken shape of\n\nbrutality, humiliation and harassment after the First World War. In fact the\n\ntechnique, style or forms which the soldiers participating in the War had\n\nlearnt and faced in army atmosphere, were brought by them, when they re-\n\nentered in the colleges after returning from the War. Actually these forms\n\nwere devised to highlight the importance of the team. Gradually these\n\ntechniques and forms passed on those persons who did not know the real\n\nmeaning of the technical word 'hazing' or 'ragging'. Now the ragging has\n\nacquired a new heinous meaning which indicates any disorderly conduct\n\nwhether by words spoken or written or by an act which has the effect of\n\nteasing, treating or handling with rudeness any other student, indulging in\n\nrowdy or undisciplined activities which causes or is likely to cause\n\nannoyance, hardship or psychological harm or to raise fear or apprehension\n\nthereof in a fresher or a junior student or asking the student to do any act or\n\nperform something which such student will not do in the ordinary course\n\nand which has the effect of causing or generating a sense of shame or\n\nembarrassment so as to adversely affect the physique or psyche of a fresher\n\nor a junior student.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_80\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_81\">25.   A rare and strange case of ragging is as follows -Pyotr Ilyich\n\nTchaikousky was a renowned composer of Russia. It was reported in 1893\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                     20</span>\n\fthat he died due to cholera and cholera was caused due to drinking of\n\ncontaminated water. This was a blatant lie. However, this lie prevailed for\n\nabout a century. The truth was revealed by, Alexandra Orlova, the\n\nbiographer of the composer and that too when the composer died and the\n\nbiographer migrated to America. The biographer revealed that the Russian\n\ncomposer was a homosexual during his education period and this fact\n\nbecame known to college authorities and they decided to punish the\n\ncomposer and was likely to be expelled. The news of proposed punishment\n\nleaked to his old classmates and they thought that if the composer is\n\npunished it will bring a bad name to the institution. Therefore, the composer\n\nwas summoned before eight former classmates in the \"Court of Honour\" and\n\nwas asked to end his own life to \"preserve the good name of the school\".\n\nThe composer ended his life by consuming poison brought by one of the\n\nJudges and story of death by cholera was concocted.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_82\">26.   After consideration of the reports, we direct that the Government in\n\nthe States and the Union Territories and the University shall act in terms of\n\nthe guidelines formulated by the Constituted Committee. The MCI, BCI in\n\nconsultation with UGC shall frame the requisite regulations which shall be\n\nbinding on the institutions. They shall be indicated to the students at the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                    21</span>\n\ftime of admission by appropriate provision in the prospectus issued for\n\nadmission. The consequences which flow from not observing the guidelines\n\nshall also be indicated. Inquiries which are pending shall be completed and\n\nreport shall be submitted before this Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_83\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_84\">27.   A question raised was regarding giving opportunity to the offender\n\nbefore taking actions like expulsion etc. Delay in taking action in many\n\ncases would frustrate the need for taking urgent action. In such cases if the\n\nauthorities are prima facie satisfied about the errant act of any student, they\n\ncan in appropriate cases pending final decision, suspend the student from\n\nthe institution and the hostel if any and give opportunity to him to have his\n\nsay. Immediately, the police shall be informed and criminal law set into\n\nmotion. If it comes to the notice of the university or controlling body that\n\nany educational institution is trying to shield the errant students, they shall\n\nbe free to reduce the grants in aid and in serious cases deny grants in aids.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_85\">28.

No.1 of 2007 is allowed and Sanjib Das who was arrayed in SLP (C)\n\nNo.12129/2006 as one of the respondents is permitted to be transposed as a petitioner.\n\fConsequently, the number of petitioners in that case becomes eight. Apart from the\n\neight petitioners in SLP(C) No.12129/2006 there are two each in SLP(C) No. 12766 of\n\n2006 and SLP (C) No.17979 of 2006 and two more in I.A. No.5/2009 filed in SLP (C)\n\nNo. 17979/2006.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">2.         Leave granted in all the SLPs.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">3.         The three appeals are directed against the judgment and order dated May\n\n17, 2006 passed by a full bench of the Guwahati High Court disposing of a large\n\ngroup of writ petitions. The appellants, however, are aggrieved by the decision only\n\nin so far as it found and held that the selections made for filling up the vacancies in\n\nthe posts of Lower Division Assistant (LDA) were bad and the select list, dated June\n\n24, 2003 was illegal and consequently set it aside.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">4.         The controversy relates to appointments to the vacant posts of Lower\n\nDivision Assistants in the Transport Department, Government of Assam for which\n\nthe concerned authorities, following a selection process, prepared the select list dated\n\nJune 24, 2003. The eight appellants in Civil Appeal arising from SLP(C) No.12129/\n\n2006 were among the 12 selected candidates in the select list that was set aside by the\n\nHigh Court. They are thus directly hit by the High Court judgment. The other six\n\nappellants in the other two Civil Appeals and I.A. No.5 of 2009 admittedly did not\n\nfigure in the select list dated June 24, 2003. According to them, they were in some\n\nearlier list dated November 20, 2001 on the basis of which the select list of June 24,\n\n2003 was finally drawn up. Their case is thus materially different from the case of the\n\neight appellants in Civil Appeal arising from SLP(C) No.12129 /2006.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">5.           For filling up the vacancies in the posts of LDA in the Transport\n\nDepartment, Govt. of Assam, the selection process commenced in October, 1998. As is\n\nnot uncommon these days, even before it was complete the selection process had to go\n\nthrough obstacles and face challenges in the Court. But having regard to the limited\n\nscope of these appeals it is not necessary to go into those details. Suffice it to note that\n\fon the basis of a written test held on November 14, 1999 and viva voce held on\n\nDecember 18, 2000 a select list was eventually prepared and in pursuance of the\n\ndirection of the Guwahati High Court dated October 10, 2001 in W.P.(C) No. 4431 of\n\n2001 it came to be finally published on June 24, 2003. It is not in dispute that the\n\neight appellants in Civil Appeal arising from SLP(C) No.12129/ 2006 were among the\n\n12 selected candidates in that list.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">6.          After the select list was published on June 24, 2003 appellants 1 &amp; 2 (along\n\nwith some others) filed W.P. (C) No.6139 of 2003 before the Guwahati High Court\n\nseeking direction for appointment on the basis of the select list. In that case the High\n\nCourt passed an interim order on August 8, 2003 directing that any existing vacancies\n\nshould be filled up from the select list and prohibiting any ad hoc appointments from\n\noutside that list. A similar order was passed by the High Court on March 5, 2004 in\n\nW.P. (C) No. 8815 of 2004 filed by one Inamul Hoque (who was at serial No.7 in that\n\nselect list). Earlier to that a writ petition being W.P. (C) No.66222 of 2003 was filed,\n\nthe petitioner's in which challenged the select list dated June 24, 2003 published by\n\nthe Joint Commissioner Transport, Government of Assam and sought direction for\n\ntheir appointment on the basis of some purported select list dated February 21, 2006.\n\nThis writ petition too was one of the batch of cases disposed of by the full bench\n\njudgment against which the present appeals are preferred. The High Court found\n\nand held that there was no such select list as claimed by the petitioners of that case\n\nand that part of the judgment is not under appeal before us. In yet another\n\nproceeding, in Contempt Case No. 314 of 2003 the Guwahati High Court gave\n\ndirections to the concerned authorities in the government to complete the process of\n\nappointment within six weeks in accordance with law.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">7.          The aforementioned were some of the matters relating to the select list\n\ndated June 24, 2003 and the claim of the selected candidates for appointment based\n\non that list.\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">\f8.          As against that there was a counter claim for regularization as LDAs by\n\nsome casual employees working in the department. A writ petition being W.P. (C) No.\n\n1154 of 2004 came to be filed before the High Court on March 5, 2004 by some casual\n\nemployees seeking stay on the appointments from the select list and on the same day\n\n(March 5, 2004) the High Court directed the concerned authorities not to issue any\n\nappointment orders for the post of LDAs till the next date (March 11, 2004) fixed in\n\nthe case.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">9.          Eventually all the writ petitions raising claims for appointment on\n\ndifferent grounds as LDA in the transport department came to be grouped together\n\nand in view of the conflicting orders passed in different writ petitions the entire\n\ngroup came to be heard by a full bench of the Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">10.         The full bench by a long and well considered judgment totally rejected the\n\nclaim of regularization raised by the casual employees but at the same time it found\n\nand held that the selection process was not fair and proper and consequently set aside\n\nthe select list of June 24, 2003. In paragraph 23 of the judgment the Court\n\nsummarized its decisions as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">            \"Our answers to the questions referred and also to the questions\n            incidentally arising are self-contained in the various paragraphs\n            of the present order. However, to dispel all doubts and avoid any\n            possible confusion we deem it appropriate to reiterate our\n            conclusions to follows:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">       (1) The Office Memorandum dated 20.4.1995 does not reflect a Valid\n           policy decision of the State for regularization of Muster Roll/Work\n           Charge employees.</blockquote><p id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">            No Muster Roll/Work Charge employee is entitled in law to seek\n            and claim regularization in terms of the aforesaid Office\n            Memorandum dated 20.4.1995,\n\n       (2) However, as a large number of regularisations of different\n           categories of employees have already been effected in terms of the\n           Office Memorandum dated 20.4.1995, considering the human\n           factor involved, the Court does not consider it necessary to pass\n           orders setting aside any of the said regularizations. However, there\n\f           will be no further regularization in terms of the aforesaid Office\n           Memorandum, dated 20.4.1995, and/or such other judicial order(s)\n           for regularization, passed, in this regard, but has not yet been\n           implemented.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">       (3) The Office Memorandum dated 20.4.1995 does not cover any\n           category of employees other than Muster Roll and Work Charge\n           employees. No policy decision has been taken by the State with\n           regard     to   regularization     of   different    categories   of\n           casual/contingent/adhoc employees working in the different\n           departments of the State Government. Such employees are,\n           therefore, not entitled to claim any regularization either under the\n           Office Memorandum dated 20.4.1995 or any other Office\n           Memorandum in force.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_17\">\n\n       (4) Casual employees of the Transport department in Grade III posts\n           are not entitled to regularization in terms of the Office\n           Memorandum dated 20.4.1995 or any other Office Memorandum\n           in force.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_18\">       (5) The selections held for filling up the vacant posts of L. D.\n           Assistants in the Transport department including the select list\n           dated 24.6.2003 is found to be illegal and therefore set aside.\n\n       (6) The Court expresses no opinion with regard to the validity of the\n           Cabinet decision dated 22.7.20005 or its implementation and\n           execution. The matter will be considered, if required, at the\n           appropriate time and stage.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_19\">           All the writ petitioners shall stand disposed of as being answered\n           in terms our conclusions recorded above.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_20\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">11.        As noted above the appellants are aggrieved by the finding at serial No.5\n\nin regard to the select list and the direction to set it aside.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">12.        Mr. P.K. Goswami learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants in\n\nCivil Appeal arising from SLP(C) No.12129/2006 submitted that the manner in which\n\nthe High Court proceeded to examine the validity of the selection process and the\n\nreason assigned by it for holding the select list to be bad and invalid were quite\n\nunsustainable in law. Learned Counsel submitted that though the pleadings in the\n\nwrit petition challenging the select list were found by the High Court as scanty yet it\n\nproceeded to consider the select list by examining the official records summoned by it.\n\fMr. Goswami submitted that the only reason assigned for holding the select list to be\n\nbad was contained in paragraph 27 of the judgment which is as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">           \"The unselected candidates have also raised a question with\n           regard to the validity of the selection process. Through the writ\n           petitions filed in this regard do not contain any elaborate\n           pleadings, as the records in original had been called for and\n           placed before the Court and the same has been duly perused, we\n           are of the view that it will only be correct for the Court to record\n           its views in the matter on the basis of the original records made\n           available for scrutiny of the Court instated of non-suiting the\n           petitioners on the ground of the scanty pleadings contained in the\n           writ petitions.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"p_23\">13.        Having examined the records the High Court recorded its reason for\n\nstriking down the select list as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">           \"In this regard we have considered the marks awarded to the\n           candidates who had undergone the selection and on such\n           consideration we find that each of the selected candidates has\n           been given very high marks in the interview segment and it is only\n           on account of such high marks in the interview that the said\n           candidates have been selected. While it is correct that the selected\n           candidates have also secured equally high marks in the written test\n           we have also noticed that other candidates who had secured\n           equally high and even higher marks in the written test in that the\n           selected candidates have fared very poorly in the interview. The\n           scrutiny of the marks awarded to the successful and unsuccessful\n           candidates reveal a distinct pattern i.e. those who have been\n           selected have secured very high marks in the interview whereas\n           those unselected have secured very low marks in the interview\n           held. Such a uniform pattern, in our considered view, is unnatural\n           and in spite of our best efforts we have not been able to persuade\n           ourselves to accept the final result of the selection. We, therefore,\n           set aside the select list dated 24.6.2003 and direct the posts in\n           question to be readvertised. ..........\".\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_24\">14.        We are unable to appreciate or even follow the reason assigned by the\n\nHigh Court for condemning the select list. In case, in viva voce very high marks were\n\ngiven to candidates who secured low or very low marks in the written test that might\n\nbe a ground for suspicion. But if the candidates securing high marks in the written\n\ntest were able to secure equally high marks in viva voce we are unable to find any\n\nanomaly. After all there has to be some difference between the selected and the\n\funselected candidates. Unfortunately the High Court has not made clear the `distinct\n\npattern' it was able to discern from a scrutiny of the marks awarded to the\n\ncandidates. The selection records are not before us and we do not have the benefit of\n\nits perusal but we are clearly of the view that the approach of the High Court was\n\nquite contrary to law laid down by this Court. <a href=\"/doc/51922/\" id=\"a_1\">In Sadananda Halo and Others vs.\n\nMomtaz Ali Sheikh and Other</a>, 2008 (4) SCC 619 this Court, in Paragraph 49 of the\n\njudgment, observed as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_25\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">          \"49. Learned Single Judge in his judgment has observed that as\n          per the report of the amicus curiae the selected candidates got\n          higher marks in viva voce ranging between 30 and 41 marks. In\n          our opinion this has hardly any effect and merely because the\n          selected candidates got the higher marks ranging between 30 to 41\n          marks that by itself could be no reason to reject the selection. We\n          have extensively referred to the comments made by the learned\n          Single Judge in the earlier part of the judgment where the learned\n          Judge has in fact recorded his satisfaction for the printed charts\n          and more particularly about their authenticity. The learned Judge\n          has also expressed his satisfaction with the procedure adopted.\n          There is hardly any reason given by the learned Single Judge\n          excepting that the benchmark of 250 candidates had already been\n          crossed.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_26\">15.       Paragraphs 58 and 65 of the judgment are also relevant for the present\n\nand are reproduced below:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">          \"58. It is settled law that in such writ petitions a roving inquiry on\n          the factual aspect is not permissible. The High Court not only\n          engaged itself into a non-permitted fact-finding exercise but also\n          went on to rely on the findings of the amicus curiae, or as the case\n          may be, the scrutiny team, which in our opinion was\n          inappropriate. While testing the fairness of the selection process\n          wherein thousands of candidates were involved, the High Court\n          should have been slow in relying upon such microscopic findings.\n          It was not for the High Court to place itself into a position of a\n          fact-finding commission, that too, more particularly at the\n          instance of those petitioners who were unsuccessful candidates.</blockquote><p id=\"p_27\">\n</p><p id=\"p_28\">          The High Court should, therefore, have restricted itself for the\n          Selection Committee and also in the process assumed the role of\n          the respondents. Unfortunately, the High Court took it upon itself\n          the task of substituting itself for the Selection Committee and also\n          in the process assumed the role of an appellate tribunal which\n          was, in our opinion, not proper. Thus, the High Court converted\n          this writ petition into a public interest litigation without any\n\f           justification.\"\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">           \"65. We also do not approve of the approach adopted by the\n           learned Single Judge of the High Court as going all the way into\n           the facts and the microscopic details not via the pleadings of the\n           parties but on the basis of an unnecessary investigation. We also\n           disapprove of the logic of relying on the findings arrived at only\n           on the basis of sample survey. Such selection of large number of\n           candidates could not have been set aside on the basis of same\n           survey. NO evidence was available before us as to the proportion\n           of this so called \"sample survey\"\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_29\">16.        To the same effect are two earlier decisions of the Court in Madan Lal and\n\nOthers. vs. State of J &amp; K and Others, 1995 (3) SCC 486 Paragraphs 10 and 17 and in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/634160/\" id=\"a_2\">Ashok Kumar Yadav vs. State of Haryana</a> 1985 (4) SCC 417 Para.21.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_30\">17.        In view of the discussion made above we are unable to sustain the decision\n\nof the High Court in so far as it held the select list dated June 24, 2003 as invalid.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_31\">18.        We are informed that following the direction of the High Court a fresh\n\nselection process has been initiated to fill up the vacancies of LDAs in the Transport\n\nDepartment. But that may not affect the relief claimed by the appellants in Civil\n\nAppeal arising from SLP(C) No.12129/2006. On January 10, 2008 this Court directed\n\nthat 12 posts of LDA should be kept vacant until further orders. Civil Appeal arising\n\nfrom SLP(C) No.12129/2006 is accordingly allowed and the concerned authorities are\n\ndirected to fill up the 12 vacancies of LDAs in the Transport Department from the\n\nselect list dated June 24, 2003 strictly in order of merit ( six from the selected\n\ncandidates and six from the waiting list ). In case any of the candidates from the\n\nselect list dated June 24, 2006 does not turn up in response to the offer the vacancy\n\nwould be filled up from the fresh selection taken up as per the High Court direction.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_32\">19.        The claim of the other six appellants is not based on the select list dated\n\fJune 24, 2003. Counsel appearing on their behalf referred to a list of November 20,\n\n2001 containing the names of 42 candidates. The names of the six appellants are at\n\nserial Nos. 20, 24, 26, 31, 34, and 39. The last two candidates are said to belong to\n\nOBC category. According to the six appellants, the select list dated June 24, 2003 was\n\ndrawn up on the basis of the earlier list of 2001 in which their names also figured. It\n\nwas submitted on their behalf that there are sufficient vacancies against which they\n\ntoo could be accommodated. We are unable to see how the six appellants can be\n\ngranted any relief. In the first place the counsel appearing for the State of Assam\n\ndenied the existence of any select list dated November 20, 2001. Secondly on their own\n\nshowing the appellants are much below even in that list and no direction for their\n\nappointment can be given in disregard of the candidates above them even in that list.\n\nThe claim of these six appellants thus has no merit or substance. The two appeals\n\narising from SLP(C) No.12766 of 2006 and SLP (C) No.17979 of 2006 and I.A. No.\n\n5/2009 (filed in SLP (C) No.17979/2006) are accordingly dismissed.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_33\">                                                                        ......................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_34\">                                               [Tarun Chatterjee]\n\n\n\n                                                                        ......................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_35\">                                               [Aftab Alam]\nNew Delhi,\nFebruary 25, 2009.\n</p>\f","tid":126854026,"showurl":true,"citeList":[{"tid":634160,"url":"http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgst.aspx?filename=9262","title":"Ashok Kumar Yadav And Ors.

Piara Singh P.W.-5. Maghar Singh in his statement\n\nmade before S.I. Piara Singh stated that he was resident of village Mansa Khurd.\n\nThey were seven brothers eldest being Bant Singh who was residing at village Bhagi\n\nBander for the last 3 years. First marriage was solemnized with Jangir Kaur and\n\nsecond marriage (kareva) was performed with accused Manjit Kaur.         His first wife\n\nJangir Kaur gave birth to two sons and one daughter. Out of them,          eldest was\n\nAmarjit Kaur, whereas younger to her was Balbir Singh and youngest to all was\n\nJaswinder Singh. Amarjit Kaur was married with Nidhan Singh at\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                          -3-</span>\n\n\n\nBathinda and Jaswinder Singh was also doing labour work at Bathinda. Manjit Kaur\n\ngave birth to Virpal Kaur and accused Ginder Singh. Virpal Kaur was married with\n\nAngrez Singh. His brother Bant Singh did not have cordial relations with his younger\n\fson Ginder Singh. For this reason Ginder Singh was residing at Bathinda. On the day\n\nof Baisakhi his brother Bant Singh had given beatings to his wife Manjit Kaur and on\n\naccount thereof, there was a dispute in the house. A day before lodging the FIR he\n\nalongwith Makhan Singh Ex-Sarpanch had come to village Bhagi Bander at about 4\n\nP.M. in order to settle the dispute where the son-in-law of Bant Singh, namely Angrez\n\nSingh and Ginder Singh and Balbir Singh his nephews, his borther's wives Manjit\n\nKaur and Jangir Kaur were present in the house. Dut to old age, the eye sight of\n\nJangir Kaur had become weak. His brother Bant Singh came to the house at about 8\n\np.m. and inquired about his welfare. At that time an electric light in the courtyard was\n\non. They started talking about the settlement of the dispute. It was about 9.30 p.m.\n\nDuring the course of settlement Ginder Singh and Bant Singh exchanged hot words\n\nand his brother Bant Singh stood up and\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                          -4-</span>\n\nstarted going to his room. Ginder Singh picked up a Gandhali lying nearby and gave\n\ntwo blows with the same on the head of Bant Singh which hit his head. Thereafter\n\nAngrez Singh took Bant Singh in his grip and Balbir Singh picked up a soti lying there\n\nand gave soti blow on shin on right leg of Bant Singh. Ginder Singh gave one more\n\nblow with Gandhali to Bant Singh which hit him on the left ear and back side of the\n\near. Balbir Singh gave a soti blow which hit the right side of his head as a result of\n\nwhich his brother Bant Singh fell down. Makhan Singh and he himself raised an\n\falarm, \"Na Maro, Na Maro\" (don't kill, don't kill). When his brother Bant Singh was\n\nlying fallen, Angrez Singh continued twisting his left arm while Ginder Singh\n\ncontinued twisting his left knee. While Bant Singh was lying on the ground, Manjit\n\nKaur and Balbir Singh continued giving blows thrustwise with their respective sotis on\n\nthe left leg and back side of left knee and Manjit Kaur kept on saying loudly that he\n\nshould be taught a lesson for giving beatings to her. As a result thereof his brother\n\nsustained injuries on his left leg. They stepped forward to rescue him but the accused\n\ntried to attack them also. His brother Bant Singh succumbed to his injuries at the spot.\n\nOut\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                          -5-</span>\n\nof fear they ran away outside and informed Jangir Singh Sarpanch about this\n\noccurrence. After taking along Jangir Singh Sarpanch with them, they had come to\n\nlodge the report. The cause of grudge was that about a month back on the day of\n\nBaisakhi, his brother Bant Singh had given beatings to his wife Manjit Kaur and whole\n\nfamily was fed up with him. On account of this grudge, all the accused had connived\n\nwith one another and committed the murder of Bant Singh by inflicting injuries to him.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">          The first information report was lodged on 21/5/94 at 5.10 a.m. while the\n\nalleged offence took place on 20/5/1994 at about 9.30 p.m. The special report reached\n\nthe concerned Magistrate at Bathinda on 21.5.1994 at 7.30 a.m. Two witnesses were\n\npressed into service as eye witnesses. They were P.W. 3 and 4. The trial Court held\n\fthat the presence of these two witnesses at the time of occurrence was not established.\n\nNotwithstanding such conclusion as noted above two persons were convicted.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">             In appeal the stand of the accused persons was that the FIR was delayed;\n\nthe eye witnesses were disbelieved and, therefore, the question of holding the accused\n\npersons guilty does not arise.       The High Court accepted the stand and directed\n\nacquittal.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                             -6-</span>\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">             In support of the appeal learned counsel for the appellant - State submitted\n\nthat it is a peculiar case where the deceased was allegedly killed by his wife and a son,\n\nand out of two eye witnesses who were there; one was his brother and the other was\n\nhis friend. That being so, there was obviously an attempt to protect the accused\n\npersons.     Learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand supported the\n\njudgment of the High Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">             Even though it is accepted that there were two eye witnesses; one was the\n\nbrother of the deceased and the other was friend and there was an attempt to protect\n\nthe accused there is no credible evidence to show involvement of the accused persons\n\nin the concerned crime. That being so, their conviction would not be proper. High\n\nCourt has precisely held so. That being the position, we are not inclined to interfere in\n\nthis appeal.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">             Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">                                       ................ .J.\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">                                                          (Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT)\n\f                                                ...................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">                    (V.S.

Along with the application he annexed the papers presented by him\nat the National and International Forums and the books authored by him.             His\napplication was considered in the joint meeting of the Academic Committee and\nAdministrative Committee of the Department of Laws, Panjab University, held on 29th\nJuly, 2008, and was rejected. The High Court dismissed the writ petition filed by the\nappellant by observing that he does not have an enforceable right for consideration of\ndegree of Ph.D and the issue raised by him does not call for interference under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_1\">Article\n226</a> of the Constitution.\n</p><p id=\"p_4\">           It is not in dispute that in terms of Regulations 1, 2 and 3 of the Panjab\nUniversity Calendar Volume-II, 1995 (for short `the Regulations'), the appellant's\ncase was required to be considered by the Research Degree Committee on\n                                                                                  ....2/-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                         -2-</span>\n<p id=\"p_5\">being recommended by the Faculty of Law.           It is also not in dispute that the\nappellant's case was not considered by the Faculty of Law for the purpose of being\nrecommended to the Research Degree Committee. The High Court overlooked this\npatent illegality in the rejection of the appellant's application and summarily\ndismissed the writ petition. In our view, the High Court should have considered the\nissue raised by the appellant in the light of the Regulations and decided the same on\nmerits.

No.171 of 1996.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_2\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_3\">               By the impugned order the complaint filed by the appellant has been\n\n   dismissed by the Commission on the ground that it was barred by limitation. The\n\n   Commission has noted that the claim made on the Bank was lastly on 16th May,\n\n   1994 and the complaint was filed on 26th August, 1996, which was obviously\n\n   beyond the period of limitation.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">               We have heard learned counsel for the parties.       Mr. Shiv Pujan\n\n   Singh, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant has strenuously urged\n\n   that the Commission has erred in not condoning the delay in preferring the\n\n   complaint because there was sufficient cause for the delay. It is pleaded that the\n\n   appellant was arrested in some case on 5th June, 1994; he remained in custody for\n\n   a\n\n                                                                             ..2/-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                       :2:</span>\n\n   period of about eight months and was released on bail only on 4th February, 1995\n\f       and therefore, he was prevented by a sufficient cause in not preferring the\n\n       complaint within time.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">                     In the light of the facts found by the Commission, we are not\n\n       persuaded to agree with the learned counsel. It is manifest that the Commission\n\n       was not oblivious of the fact that the appellant was in jail till 4 th February, 1995.\n\n       As a matter of fact, taking note of the factum of arrest of the appellant and his\n\n       release on bail on 4th February, 1995, the Commission has observed that since 19th\n\n       December, 2001 it had been asking the appellant to produce the evidence by\n\n       means of an affidavit to explain the delay in filing of complaint on 26th August,\n\n       1996 after his release on 4th February, 1995. However, no affidavit was filed on\n\n       behalf of the appellant. Under the circumstances, the Commission had no option\n\n       but to dismiss the complaint as barred by limitation.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">                     We do not find any infirmity in the impugned order warranting our\n\n       to interference.

This appeal is directed against the final judgment and\n\n     order dated 23rd of October, 2008 passed by the High\n\n     Court of Judicature at Allahabad in Writ Petition\n\n     No.5158 of 1989. By the impugned final judgment, the\n\n     High Court had allowed the writ petition filed by the\n\n     landlord- respondent No.3 and the suit of the landlord\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                                          2</span>\n\n\n     for eviction and for recovery of arrears of rent was\n\n     decreed.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">3.   The writ petition arose in the following manner :-\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">     A suit was filed by the landlord-respondent before a\n\nlearned Judge of the Small Causes Court at Allahabad for\n\neviction of the appellants and also for arrears of rent, inter\n\nalia, on the ground that the appellant No.1 was a defaulter\n\nin payment of rent in respect of No.39 B, Allahabad\n\nAgricultural Institute, Naini (hereinafter referred to as the\n\n`suit premises') and in view of Section 2(1)(b) read with\n\nSection 3(q) of the U.P. Urban Buildings Regulation of\n\nLetting, Rent and <a href=\"/doc/463150/\" id=\"a_1\">Eviction Act</a>, 1972 (in short the `<a href=\"/doc/1490821/\" id=\"a_2\">U.P. Act</a>'),\n\nthe appellant No.1 was not entitled to occupy the suit\n\npremises after termination of his employment. The learned\n\nJudge of the Small Causes Court came to a finding that the\n\nprovision of the <a href=\"/doc/1490821/\" id=\"a_3\">U.P. Act</a> were applicable to the suit\n\npremises and further the suit premises was not allotted to\n\nappellant No.1 as a part of contract of his employment and\n\nthat there was no default in payment of rent. It was also\n\nheld by the Small Causes Court that the tenancy was not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                                        3</span>\n\n\nvalidly terminated. Accordingly, the suit was dismissed on\n\nthe aforesaid grounds. Feeling aggrieved, the landlord-\n\nrespondent preferred a revision case before the District\n\nJudge, Allahabad. By an order dated 25th of January, 1989,\n\nthe said revision case was allowed and the matter was\n\nremitted back to the trial court to decide the case afresh\n\nstating that the finding was not recorded on a proper\n\nappraisal of the entire evidence on record and accordingly\n\nthe learned Judge of the Small Causes Court had acted\n\nillegally and with material irregularity in the exercise of his\n\njurisdiction. Against the aforesaid order of remand passed\n\nby the revisional court, the appellants filed a writ petition\n\nchallenging the aforesaid order of remand. Before the High\n\nCourt, it is an admitted position that the order of remand\n\nwas challenged at the instance of the appellants. The High\n\nCourt by the impugned order had set aside the order of the\n\nrevisional court and allowed the eviction petition by passing\n\na final order in the following manner :-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">         \"Accordingly, writ petition is disposed of.\n         Revision filed by landlord respondent No.3 is\n         allowed. Judgment and decree passed by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                                           4</span>\n\n\n         trial court is set aside. Suit of the plaintiff for\n         eviction and for recovery of arrears of rent is\n         decreed.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"p_6\">4.   It is this order which was challenged by the\n\n     appellants by way of a special leave petition which\n\n     on grant of leave was heard in presence of the\n\n     learned counsel for the parties.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">5.   In our view, the judgment of the High Court needs\n\n     to be set aside on a very short point. It is an\n\n     admitted position that there was no order of\n\n     eviction either passed by the trial court or by the\n\n     revisional court. In fact the trial court by its final\n\n     order had rejected the application for eviction\n\n     against which revision was moved which set aside\n\n     the said order and directed remand on the ground\n\n     stated in the said order, therefore, the question of\n\n     decreeing or directing the eviction of the appellants\n\n     in the writ petition filed by the tenants could not\n\n     arise at all. It is also an admitted position, that the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                                    5</span>\n\n\nrevisional   court   on   the   revisional   application\n\nremanded the matter to the trial court for fresh\n\ndecision. Feeling aggrieved by the said decision of\n\nthe revisional court, the appellants- tenants had\n\nfiled a writ petition. In such a writ petition, it was\n\nnot open to the High Court to direct the eviction of\n\nthe appellants when the landlord-respondent had\n\nnot moved against the order of remand and\n\nsecondly there was no order of eviction passed\n\neither by the trial court or by the revisional court.\n\nIn our view, this is not permissible. Since there was\n\nno order of eviction and when admittedly the\n\ntenants had moved a writ petition against an order\n\nof remand passed by the revisional court, the\n\nquestion of passing a decree or order of eviction on\n\na writ application, which was filed not by the\n\nlandlord but by the tenants, could not arise at all.\n\nThat being the position, we set aside the judgment\n\nof the High Court and the matter is remitted back to\n\nthe High Court for fresh decision on the question\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                                                6</span>\n\n\n     whether the order of remand passed by the\n\n     revisional court was justified in the facts and\n\n     circumstances of the case.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">6.   For the reasons aforesaid the impugned order is set\n\naside. The appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above.\n\nThe High Court is requested to decide the writ petition on\n\nthe question indicated hereinabove at an early date\n\npreferably within four months from the date of supply of a\n\ncopy of this order. No order as to costs.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">                                              ........................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">                                              [Tarun Chatterjee]\n\n\nNew Delhi;                                  ..........................J.\nFebruary 06, 2009.

On notice being served, the respondents are now\n\nrepresented by their learned counsel. The learned counsel\n\nfor the respondents has drawn our attention to the\n\nundertaking filed by the petitioner in the High Court\n\nshowing that he shall vacate the premises in question, a\n\ncopy of the said undertaking has also been brought on\n\nrecord. Since the petitioner has filed the undertaking before\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                1</span>\n\fthe High Court and thereafter filed the special leave\n\npetition,     we   do   not   think,   in   the   exercise   of   our\n\ndiscretionary power, to grant any interim order to the\n\npetitioner.    Mr.Sushil      Kumar     Jain,     learned    counsel\n\nappearing for the petitioner however, has drawn our\n\nattention to the two decisions of this Court in the cases of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/135290/\" id=\"a_1\">P.R.Deshpande vs. Maruti Balaram Haibatti</a> [1998 (6)\n\nSCC 507] and <a href=\"/doc/1929772/\" id=\"a_2\">A.V.G.P.Chettiar &amp; Sons and Ors. vs.\n\nT.Palanisamy Gounder</a> [2002 (5) SCC 337]. Relying on the\n\naforesaid two decisions, Mr.Jain submitted that in spite of\n\nthe fact that an undertaking has been filed by the petitioner\n\nto vacate the premises in question, even then the petitioner\n\nis entitled to an interim order of stay of dispossession. We\n\nare not inclined to go into this question as grant of stay of\n\ndispossession during the pendency of a Special Leave\n\nPetition is a discretion of the court.

Shiv Lal &amp; Ors.:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">           The learned Additional Judge had evolved and applied the belting system to\n\nthe lands in question categorising/dividing the said lands into three separate and\n\ndistinct categories. For category 'A', the learned Additional District Judge awarded\n\nthe rate of Rs.8,00,000/- per acre; for category 'B', he awarded the rate of\n\nRs.7,00,000/- per acre and for category 'C', he awarded the rate of Rs.4,00,000/- per\n\nacre. This was challenged by way of First Appeal in which the learned Single Judge\n\nof the High Court reduced the above three categories into two categories and,\n\nconsequently, awarded the rate of Rs.7,04,367/- per acre for category 'A' and\n\nRs.6,00,000/- per acre for category 'B'. Against the decision of the learned Single\n\nJudge of the High Court, the matter was carried in L.P.A. which stood dismissed,\n\nhence, this Civil Appeal by the State.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">           The main contention of the State is that the learned Single Judge had erred\n\nin reducing the number of categories from three to two. We do not find any merit in\n\nthis argument for the following reasons:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">                                                                     ...3/-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">\n\nC.A.No.58/2005 etc...contd...\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                           -3-</span>\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">           Firstly, in the case of Pawan Kumar &amp; Anr. Vs. Land Acquisition Collector\n\n(L.P.A.No.387/2001 decided on 15.5.2006), it has been held by the High Court that\n\fbelting system is not applicable to municipal areas abutting the abadi. In the said\n\njudgment, the Division Bench has held that the land in question falling within the\n\nmunicipal area abutting the abadi had great potential.    As stated above, this decision\n\nhas not been challenged by the State by filing a special leave petition. It has become\n\nfinal.   Consequently, two sets of decrees would result - in one set of cases, the\n\nclaimants would get compensation on the basis of belting system (if the State succeeds\n\nin its Civil Appeal) and in the other set of cases, the claimants would get\n\ncompensation at higher rate on the basis that belting is not applicable. The judgment\n\nand decree passed by the High Court in Pawan Kumar's case has now become final\n\nas the State has not challenged the said judgment.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">           Before us, it was argued that if this Court upholds the applicability of the\n\nbelting system as done by the learned Additional District Judge in the case of State of\n\nHaryana Vs. Shiv Lal, then the law declared by the High Court\n\n                                                                        ..4/-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">\n\nC.A.No.58/2005 etc...contd...\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                           -4-</span>\n\nin Pawan Kumar's case would need reconsideration. We do not find any merit in this\n\nargument for the simple reason that the judgment and decree passed by the High\n\nCourt in Pawan Kumar's case has become final. Lastly, it may be pointed out that\n\nunder the notification issued under the <a href=\"/doc/7832/\" id=\"a_1\">Land Acquisition Act</a>, in these cases,\n\ncompensation has been unconditionally paid to all the claimants in 2001 and\n\nonwards. In the circumstances, on account of inconsistent decrees coming into the\n\nfield, we do not wish to interfere in the Civil Appeal(s) filed by State of Haryana.\n\f           As regards appeal(s) filed by the claimant(s) for enhancement, we find no\n\nreason to interfere as the High Court has correctly applied the belting system of\n\nvaluation to the facts of the case.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_17\">           Accordingly, all the Appeals and cross appeals are dismissed, with no order\n\nas to costs.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_18\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">                                      ...................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">                                                         (S.H.

Challenge in this appeal is to the order of a Division Bench of the\n\nOrissa High Court. Factual background can be adumbrated concisely as\n\nfollows:\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">\f4.    The responded no.1 filed a writ application being OJC No.6857 of\n\n1996 before the Orissa High Court claiming that he was appointed as\n\n\"fourth peon\" by the management of the concerned institution, which is an\n\n\"aided educational institution\" as defined under the Orissa Education Act,\n\n1969 (in short the `Act') and Orissa Education (Recruitment and Conditions\n\nof Service of Teachers and Members of the Staff of Aided Educational\n\nInstitutions) Rules, 1974 (in short `Recruitment Rules'). It is not in dispute\n\nthat if an institution is an aided educational institution, same is governed by\n\nthe Act and rules framed thereunder. The Recruitment Rules are framed\n\nunder the Act. As the functionaries of the State did not approve the\n\nappointment holding the same to be beyond the prescribed yardstick, writ\n\napplications were filed for direction to the concerned authorities to accord\n\napproval to the appointment.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">5.    The High Court by the impugned judgment in writ application came\n\nto hold that the functionaries of the State were not justified in refusing to\n\naccord approval. Stand of the State Government was that circular dated\n\n8.7.1981 contained yardstick for fixation of standard staff for the Non-\n\nGovernment Secondary Schools in supersession of earlier circulars. Under\n\nthe \"category of staff\" the number of peons who can be appointed was\n\nclearly spelt out. Only if the roll strength of the institution exceeded a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                     2</span>\n\fparticular number, one post of \"Daftry\" was admissible. According to the\n\nState Government the post of \"Daftry\" is a promotional post and, therefore,\n\nthe concept of a \"fourth peon\" as sought to be canvassed by the writ\n\npetitioners is without any legal foundation. The position was further\n\nclarified by Circular dated 27.3.1992. The High Court on consideration of\n\nthe rival stands came to equate the \"fourth peon\" with \"Daftry\" and held the\n\nclaim of the writ petitioner warranted acceptance.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">6.    In support of the appeal, learned counsel for the State of Orissa\n\nsubmitted that the High Court missed to consider several vital aspects.\n\nFirstly, there is no prescription of a \"fourth peon\" in the yardstick\n\nprescribed. The post of \"Daftry\" is a promotional post and it carries higher\n\nscale of pay. That being the position, the last entrant cannot claim the post\n\nof the \"Daftry\".\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">7.    Per contra, learned counsel for the writ petitioner submitted that the\n\nHigh Court has considered the circulars and come to the right conclusion\n\nthat the claim for appointment as the \"fourth peon\" is legally enforceable.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">8.    At this juncture it is to be noted that at different points of time\n\nyardsticks were formulated. Government of Orissa, Education &amp; Y.S.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                     3</span>\n\fDepartment, issued Circular No. 28365-EYS dated 8.7.1981 fixing standard\n\nstaff for the non-government secondary schools. So far as peons are\n\nconcerned, the relevant portions of the circular read as follows:\n\n\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">      \"Category of staff           3 class     5class               7 class\n      ..............\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">      9.Peons (I) Office Peon 1                1            1</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">      (ii) Office Attendant        1           1            1</span>\n\n      (iii) Night watcher cum\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">             sweeper          1                1            1</span>\n\n\n\n      Notes\n\n      ................\n</pre><p id=\"p_15\">      C)(ii) Where the roll strength of the school exceeds 100 one post of\n      Daftry is admissible.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">      .......\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_17\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">9.    Subsequently by another circular No.155000-XVIIEP-50/91-E, dated\n\n27th March, 1992 the position was further clarified as under:-\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                 \"I am directed to say that the question of fixation of\n                 revised yardstick for appointment of class IV employees\n                 in Non-government Secondary Schools was under\n                 consideration of Government for some time past. After\n                 careful consideration Government have been pleased to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                       4</span>\n\f            decide that the yardstick for class IV employees of Non-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">            Government Secondary Schools shall be as follows:\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">            Category of staff            3 class    5class              7</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">            class\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">            (i) Office Peon              1          1            1</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">            (ii)Science Attendant        1          1            1</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">            (iii)Night Watcher cum 1                1            1</span>\n                   Sweeper\n\n\n\n             Where the roll strength of 10 Class High School is 500\n      (five hundred) or more, one post of Daftry admissible.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">           For the schools running shift system for shortage of\n      accommodation one additional post of peon is admissible.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">            The yardstick will come into force with effect from the\n      Ist January 1992 and Government order referred to above\n      stands modified to the extent indicated above.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">10.   A comparison of the two circulars shows that under 1981 Circular the\n\nrequisite roll strength was 100, which was changed to 500 subsequently in\n\nthe 1992 Circular.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"p_19\">11.   It is fairly accepted by learned counsel for the writ petitioner that the\n\nexpression used in the two circulars is \"Daftry\" and not \"fourth peon\". The\n\nHigh Court seems to have fallen in error by proceeding on the basis as if the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                     5</span>\n\fcirculars referred to \"fourth peon\". This is clear from the reading of the\n\nvarious judgments impugned in this appeal.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_20\">\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">12.   It is to be noted that post of \"Daftry\" carries higher scale of pay and is\n\na promotional post for class IV employees. That being the position, the High\n\nCourt was not justified in directing approval of the writ petitioner's services\n\nas \"fourth peon\". But one significant aspect cannot be lost sight of. If a\n\nschool was entitled to have a \"Daftry\", certainly the appointment was to be\n\nmade by promoting one of the three persons i.e. Office Peon, Office\n\nAttendant and Night Watcher-cum-Sweeper, there being no other class IV\n\npost in the institution. It is for the Managing Committee of the institution to\n\ndecide who is to be promoted and thereafter seek approval of the concerned\n\nauthorities. That way the claim of the writ petitioner could have been\n\nconsidered by the authorities, on being appropriately moved by the\n\nmanagement. It is undisputed that the writ petitioner was appointed by the\n\nmanaging committees', may be under a misreading of the relevant\n\ngovernment orders.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_22\">\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">13.   We, therefore, while allowing this appeal direct that the management\n\nof the concerned institution shall move the concerned authorities for\n\napproval to the promotional appointment of a class IV employee, as\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                     6</span>\n\f\"Daftry\". Simultaneously, it can also recommend for appointment to the\n\nclass IV post, in case approval is accorded to the recommendation for\n\nappointment of \"Daftry\" on promotion. The decision on both motions shall\n\nbe taken within three months from the date of submission of the\n\nrecommendation in accordance with law keeping in view the operative\n\nyardsticks in force at the time appointments were made. Even if there has\n\nbeen refusal earlier, the matter shall be reconsidered in the light of what has\n\nbeen stated above.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_24\">\n</p><p id=\"p_25\">14.   Before we part with this case we must indicate that undisputedly there\n\nwere several decision of the Division Bench rendered at earlier points of\n\ntime, taking a view contrary to the one taken in the impugned judgment.\n\nLearned counsel for the respondent (writ petitioner) fairly accepted that it is\n\nso.

This is an unfortunate litigation regarding partition of a\n\nbuilding constructed on a small piece of land between the\n\nbrothers.   It is not disputed that the land is jointly owned by\n\nboth the brothers.     The dispute is restricted over the building\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                               2</span>\n\n\nwhich has been constructed on the part of the land.   The matter\n\nhas travelled from the Subordinate Court, Trichur to this Court.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">3.   A serious endeavour has been made by this Court to\n\namicably settle the matter. On 6.8.2008, the following order was\n\npassed by this Court\"\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">           \"In the present case, the dispute is between two\n     brothers. The ownership of the land is admittedly\n     joint. The short controversy is regarding the cost of\n     construction over that plot.        The case of the\n     respondent is that he has spent the entire cost of\n     construction whereas the case of the appellant is that\n     he has also contributed equally to the cost of\n     construction.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">           In our considered view, this controversy can be\n     easily sorted out by the parties. We have requested\n     the learned counsel for the parties to ensure that the\n     matter may be amicably settled between the parties\n     and for that purpose, we adjourn this matter for four\n     weeks.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"p_6\">The dispute could not be resolved despite efforts of this court\n\nand now we have been called upon to give our judgment in the\n\nmatter.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">4.   Vinodan and Vishwanathan in the suit were the plaintiff\n\nand defendant before the trial court.   The suit was filed before\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                  3</span>\n\n\nthe trial court with the prayer that the property described in the\n\nplaint schedule was purchased jointly by the parties as per the\n\ndocument no. 806/77 and the appellant before this court\n\nVinodan is entitled to the half share of the property.      The trial\n\ncourt framed the following issues:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">     \"(1)   Whether the plaint schedule property was\n            acquired by the plaintiff and defendant jointly or\n            whether it was acquired by the defendant\n            exclusively?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">     (2)    Whether the house was constructed by both the\n            parties or by any of them exclusively?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">     (3)    Whether plaintiff is entitled to claim partition?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">     (4)    What is the quantum of mesne profits, if to be\n            paid?\n</blockquote>\n<pre id=\"pre_2\">     (5)    Equities and reservations?\n\n     (6)    Reliefs and Costs?\"\n\n\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">     The trial court after examining the evidence and hearing the\nparties came to the following finding on Issues no.1&amp;2:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">     \"I have absolutely no hesitation to hold that the\n     plaintiff and defendant had supplied funds for the\n     construction of the house and the house had been\n     constructed with that amount and so the house\n     belonged to them jointly. Similarly the property had\n     also been purchased with the funds of both and so it\n     also belongs to them jointly.\"\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                               4</span>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">5.   Regarding Issue no. 3, the trial court came to the finding\n\nthat it had to be divided into two equal shares and one such\n\nshare was allotted to the plaintiff/appellant herein and the other\n\nshare was allotted to the defendant/respondent herein.\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"p_9\">6.   Regarding Issue no.4 pertaining to mesne profits, the trial\n\ncourt held that the plaintiff/appellant was entitled to get mesne\n\nprofits from the defendant/respondent from the date of suit till\n\npossession.   The trial court further held that the quantum of\n\nmesne profits can be a matter which could be decided in the final\n\ndecree proceedings after the Commissioner would submit his\n\nreport.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">7.   The trial court directed that the property described in the\n\nplaint schedule has to be divided into two equal shares and one\n\nsuch share was allotted to the plaintiff/appellant and the other\n\nto the defendant/respondent.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">8.   The defendant/respondent Vishwanathan aggrieved by the\n\nsaid order of the Subordinate Court, Trichur filed an appeal\n\nbefore the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam.      The finding of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                5</span>\n\n\nthe High Court is that the plaintiff/appellant had been regularly\n\nsending money for the construction of the building during the\n\nperiod 1977-78.    Exhs. B-36 and B-37 go to show that the\n\nappellant had sent Rs.55,000/- during the period 1976-77 for\n\nthe construction of the building.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">9.    On a close scrutiny of all the documents available on record\n\nand the oral evidence, the High Court came to the conclusion\n\nthat on construction of the building the appellant had spent\n\nRs.55,000/- and the balance amount had been spent by the\n\nrespondent.    The High Court allowed the appeal and set aside\n\nthe order and the preliminary decree passed by the trial court. In\n\nthe impugned judgment, the High Court directed that the\n\nplaintiff/appellant was not entitled to divide the house and could\n\nonly claim Rs.55,000/- from the respondent which will be a\n\ncharge on the property of the respondent.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">10.   The appellant, aggrieved by the said judgment of the High\n\nCourt, preferred this appeal before this court.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                6</span>\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">11.   We have heard learned counsel for the parties at length.\n\nThe parties have been litigating for more than 20 years and\n\nbecause of the bitter and long litigation it may not be conducive\n\nfor the parties to stay in the same building, particularly when\n\nthey have option of residing separately because of the available\n\nland with each one of them. During the course of hearing, the\n\nlearned senior counsel appearing for the appellant gave an offer\n\nthat his client is willing to pay Rs.5,50,000/- in lieu of the share\n\nof the respondent. No offer was given by the respondent despite\n\nopportunity granted by this court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_19\">\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">12.   In the facts and circumstances of the case, while balancing\n\nthe equities and for keeping peace and happiness in the family,\n\nwe think it would be just and proper to direct the appellant to\n\npay Rs.5,50,000/- to the respondent within a period of four\n\nmonths. On receiving the said amount, the respondent may\n\nconstruct a suitable house in his portion of the land and for that\n\npurpose we grant one year's time from the date of payment of\n\nRs.5,50,000/- to the respondent to vacate the portion of the\n\nbuilding which is presently in his possession and give vacant\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                7</span>\n\n\nand peaceful possession of his portion of building to the\n\nappellant in lieu of payment of Rs.5,50,000/-. We are granting\n\nlong time to the respondent to vacate the portion of the building\n\nin his possession to avoid any inconvenience to the respondent.\n\nIn case the respondent after one year of receiving the entire\n\namount of Rs.5,50,000/- does not vacate the portion of the\n\nbuilding in his possession, in that event, the Subordinate Court\n\nis directed to ensure that the possession is taken from the\n\nrespondent and handed over to the appellant.               Perhaps this\n\nsolution may lead to ultimate peace between the families of two\n\nbrothers.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_21\">\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">13.

The Learned Counsel for applicants submitted that\n\n     applicants   are   proposing   to construct only    a\n\n     building with two storeys (ground and first floor) in\n\n     the plot in question which will not exceed the height\n\n     of the buildings on either side, on Amrita Shergil\n\n     Marg.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">\n     From the record of the case, it is evident that Plot\n\nNo. 47 belonging to the applicants faces Amrita Shergil\n\nMarg.   From the decision rendered in Civil Appeal\n\nNos.5292-5293 of 2008, it is clear that the concept of\n\n`mother plot' would not be applicable so far as Plot No.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                                                  3</span>\n\n47 is concerned because of bifurcation of original plot\n\nwhich had taken place pursuant to a decree of Court. In\n\nthe judgment which is sought to be clarified, it is held\n\nthat even if the concept of `mother plot' is not made\n\napplicable to the facts of the case, the appellants would\n\nbe entitled to construct a building of the height of the\n\nbungalow which is the lowest on the adjoining plots. It is\n\nalso clear from the clarification relating to the LBZ\n\nguidelines issued on 09.05.1997, that to have uniformity,\n\nthe height of the main building on the adjoining plots on\n\nAmrita   Shergil   Marg    will   have     to    be    taken       into\n\nconsideration and not of any building on a different road,\n\nthat is Prithvi Raj Road which is on the rear of the plot in\n\nquestion.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">3.

We must also keep in mind the fact\n\nthat the appellant has also not paid the amounts, as was directed by the order of the\n\nHigh Court, within the time specified. It is because of these two reasons that the\n\nmatter is now before us.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">       Having considered the submissions made and the facts as indicated above, we\n\nare inclined to modify the order of the High Court to the extent of extending the time\n\nfor   depositing the balance amount of Rs.2,92,596/- payable, after adjustment of\n\nRs. one lakh, which has already been deposited.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">       We, therefore, extend the time for making the deposit of the said balance\n\namount till 16th March, 2009. On payment of the said amount, the society shall\n\nforthwith hand over possession of the flat in question to the appellant.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">       As far as payment, with regard to the demands raised after June, 2007 is\n\nconcerned, it is made clear that such payments shall be made by the appellant\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                                   4</span>\n\n      without prejudice to her rights and contentions and such payment would be subject\n\n      to the final decision of the High Court in the pending writ petitions.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">             The appeal is allowed to the aforesaid extent.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">                                                           ...................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">                               (ALTAMAS KABIR)\n\n\n\n                                               ...................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">                                          (CYRIAC JOSEPH)\n\nNew Delhi,\nFebruary 25, 2009.\n</p>\f","tid":1016280,"showurl":true,"citeList":[]}, {"numcites":0,"covertids":[],"covertitles":[],"relatedqs":[{"value":"civil appeal","formInput":"civil%20appeal"},{"value":"Amrita shergill marg","formInput":"Amrita%20shergill%20marg"},{"value":"n.d.m.c.

From the decision rendered in Civil Appeal\n\nNos.5292-5293 of 2008, it is clear that the concept of\n\n`mother plot' would not be applicable so far as Plot No.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                                                  3</span>\n\n47 is concerned because of bifurcation of original plot\n\nwhich had taken place pursuant to a decree of Court. In\n\nthe judgment which is sought to be clarified, it is held\n\nthat even if the concept of `mother plot' is not made\n\napplicable to the facts of the case, the appellants would\n\nbe entitled to construct a building of the height of the\n\nbungalow which is the lowest on the adjoining plots. It is\n\nalso clear from the clarification relating to the LBZ\n\nguidelines issued on 09.05.1997, that to have uniformity,\n\nthe height of the main building on the adjoining plots on\n\nAmrita   Shergil   Marg    will   have     to    be    taken       into\n\nconsideration and not of any building on a different road,\n\nthat is Prithvi Raj Road which is on the rear of the plot in\n\nquestion.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">3.

The petitioner has also sought certain consequential\n\ndirections in regard to the protection of animals and endangered species of animals\n\napart from providing better and more natural habitat for animals in        zoos and\n\nenclosures.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_2\">2.        This Court on 9.10.2006 directed that no zoo shall permit any breeding of\n\nanimals beyond the number specified by the Central Zoo Authority in its directive\n\ndated 7.2.1995. By order dated 6.12.2007, this Court directed the Central Zoo\n\nAuthority to come up with comprehensive guidelines as to (i) how it will deal with\n\napplications for revival of recognition; (ii) the manner in which the animals in de-\n\nrecognised zoos should be dealt with. As the Court was of the view that unless there\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                            2</span>\n\nwas a direction to stop exhibiting the animals in de-recognised zoos, the zoos will not\n\nbe motivated to rectify the shortcomings and provide the up-gradation required as\n\nper the guidelines provided by the Central Zoo Authority, the said Authority is\n\ndirected to come up with proper suggestions in that regard.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_3\">3.           In pursuance of it, the Central Zoo Authority came up with guidelines and\n\nsuggestions in its affidavit filed in February, 2008 and placed before this Court on\n\n11.3.2008. This Court was informed that 509 applications were received by the\n\nCentral Zoo Authority from different zoos, rescue centres and circuses for\n\nrecognition; that the Central Zoo Authority rejected 291 applications and granted\n\nother applications. Pursuant to such rejection of 291 applications, 260 zoos/rescue\n\ncentres/circuses were closed/wound up. In view of it, this Court directed action in\n\nregard to the remaining 31. On 31.07.2008, it was reported that out of 31, 15 have\n\napplied for fresh recognition and the same was under consideration and in regard to\n\nthe remaining 16, Central Zoo Authority will write to the respective States to take\n\nappropriate action in accordance with law and provisions of the Wildlife Protection\n\nAct, 1972.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">4.           We thus find that by and large the purpose of filing the writ petition has\n\nbeen achieved. The un-recognised/de-recongnised zoos/circuses/rescue centres have\n\nbeen closed, guidelines have been issued, State Governments have been notified of the\n\nneed to comply with the provisions of the Act, Rules and the guidelines issued by the\n\nCentral Zoo Authority from time to time. In view of the above, we are of the view that\n\nthis petition can be disposed of reserving liberty to the concerned authorities to take\n\nappropriate action in accordance with law if there is violation of the Wildlife\n\n(Protection) Act, 1972 and the Rules thereunder in the respective States/Union\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                              3</span>\n\n   Territories. We dispose of this petition and the pending applications accordingly.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">   5.          Action was taken against the erring zoos      and implementation of the\n\n   provisions of the Act and the Rules could be made a reality to a reasonable extent by\n\n   the interest shown and steps taken by Shri Raj Panjwani, Advocate who assisted the\n\n   Court.

It was submitted that machines like lathe machines and\n\ndrilling machines are not capable of performing any functions without the subject\n\ntools. Before us, it was further submitted that the subject tools are rendered useless\n\nafter they are used for certain number of times. It is also pointed out that in the past,\n\nprior to Assessment Year 2000-2001, the Department has accepted that the test of\n\nwhether the subject tools constituted consumables was applied by the Department as\n\nthe relevant test in interpreting Entry 52 of the First Schedule to the Karnataka Tax\n\non Entry of Goods Act, 1979.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">          On the other hand, it is argued on behalf of the Department that the subject\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                            1</span>\n\ftools are part of the machine and that, in any event, they are accessories. It is also\n\ncontended that the test of an item being consumable is not relevant in interpreting the\n\nsaid Entry 52.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">          We quote herein-below Entry 52 of the First Schedule to the 1979 Act:\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">                    \"52. Machinery (all kinds) and parts and accessories\n          thereof but excluding agricultural machinery.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">\n\n          On going through the pleadings, particularly at pages 51, 59 and 105 of the\n\nS.L.P. paper book, we find that all throughout it was argued before the Authorities\n\nbelow, in this case, that without subject tools the lathe and drilling machines are non-\n\nfunctional.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">          As repeatedly stated in our earlier judgments, in matters of interpretation\n\nof taxing laws, this Court     must first find out whether a proper foundation is\n\nestablished by the assessee/Department before the adjudicating authority. This test\n\nhas not been complied with by the assessee in the present case. For example, assessee\n\nhas stated at page 59 of the S.L.P. paper book that \"the subject tools cannot be\n\ntermed as parts of the machine since the machine can very well function without the\n\nsaid tools, though the machine may not be in a position to carry out the specific jobs\n\nfor which these tools would be necessary. It is further stated that the subject tools are\n\nnecessary for a machine to carry out specific jobs but that fact would not make them\n\nparts of the machine.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">          As stated, what was argued before us was that lathe and drilling machines\n\nare non-functional without subject tools whereas in the above paras before the\n\nAuthorities below, the assessee submitted that lathe and drilling machines can\n\nfunction without the subject tools. We may also note that the assessee has not led\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                            2</span>\n\fevidence before the adjudicating authority to show whether the lathe and drilling\n\nmachines were non-functional in the absence of the subject tools.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">         For the aforestated reasons, we find no infirmity in the impugned judgment\n\nof the High Court and the Tribunal and, accordingly, we dismiss this Civil Appeal\n\nwhich, as stated above, relates to Assessment Year 2000-2001.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">         Be that as it may, we are of the view that it would be open to the assessee\n\nherein to raise the contention as to whether the subject tools are consumables and not\n\naccessories/parts of machine in an appropriate case(s). The reason being that\n\nAuthorities need to decide as to what distinguishes a consumable from an accessory.\n\nIf the assessee raises such a contention as is raised before us in this Appeal, the\n\nauthority shall consider the contention in accordance with law, uninfluenced by the\n\nobservations made in the impugned judgment of the High Court and the Tribunal in\n\nthis case. We also make it clear that in such an event, it would be open to the assessee\n\nherein and to the Department to raise all such contentions which are necessary for\n\ndeciding this dispute, including the contentions mentioned hereinabove.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">         Subject to above, Civil Appeal is dismissed.

This appeal is directed against the judgment and\n\n     decree dated 12th of December, 2007 passed by a\n\n     learned Judge of the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi\n\n     in RSA No.136 of 2004. By the impugned judgment,\n\n     the High Court had reduced the mesne profits granted\n\n     by the courts below from Rs.70,000/-per month to\n\n     Rs.40,000/- per month, to that extent the orders of\n\n     the courts below were modified.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                                          2</span><p id=\"p_3\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_4\">3.   It is an admitted position, the eviction order has not\n\n     been challenged. It is only against the reduction of\n\n     mesne    profits   per    month      from   Rs.70,000/-   to\n\n     Rs.40,000/- being challenged before us which on\n\n     grant of leave was heard in the presence of the learned\n\n     counsel for the parties.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">4.   In our view, the judgment of the High Court needs to\n\n     be set aside on a simple ground. That while reducing\n\n     and modifying the order of the courts below regarding\n\n     the   rate   of   mesne    profits   from   Rs.70,000/-   to\n\n     Rs.40,000/- per month, the High Court had not dealt\n\n     with the evidence         adduced    by the    parties and\n\n     considered the materials on record to come to a\n\n     conclusion that the orders of the courts below\n\n     directing Rs.70,000/- per month as mesne profits be\n\n     modified to the extent of Rs.40,000/- per month\n\n     payable to the landlord. We do not find from the\n\n     judgment that any consideration was made by the\n\n     High Court to reduce the rate of mesne profits from\n\n     Rs.70,000/- to Rs.40,000/- per month. That being the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                                              3</span>\n\n\n     position, we set aside the judgment of the High Court\n\n     and send the case back to it for fresh disposal in\n\n     accordance with law after giving hearing to the parties\n\n     and after passing a reasoned order. We request the\n\n     High Court to dispose of the second appeal within\n\n     three months from the date of supply of a copy of this\n\n     order to it.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">5.   For the reasons aforesaid, the impugned order is set\n\n     aside and the appeal is allowed to the extent indicated\n\n     above. There will be no order as to costs.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">6.   We make it clear that we have not gone into the merits\n\n     on the question of fixing the rate of mesne profits\n\n     which shall     be   decided   by the     High     Court       in\n\n     accordance with law after hearing the parties at\n\n     length.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">                                     ..............................J.\n                                     [Tarun Chatterjee]\n\n\nNew Delhi;                           ..............................J.\nFebruary 06, 2009.

The trial Court should have, after taking\nnote of the fact that the plaintiffs had taken long time to adduce their evidence, given\nfurther opportunity to the defendant-appellant to adduce evidence and then decided\nthe matter.

From a reading of the order including the\n\n     directions made in the impugned order as noted\n\n     herein above, it would be clear that the High\n\n     Court had dismissed the appeal only on the\n\n     ground that since the appellant had retired as an\n\n     ad    hoc   principal,   the   appeal   had   become\n\n     infructuous. In our view, it is true that the High\n\n     Court had granted relief to the appellant to which\n\n     he otherwise could not get, by directing payment\n\n     of salary for the period he continued as an ad hoc\n\n     principal on the strength of the interim order. In\n\n     our    view,   the   appeal,    in   the   facts   and\n\n     circumstances of the present case, ought to have\n\n     been decided on merits after giving proper\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                        2</span>\n\f     hearing to the parties.

This appeal is directed against the judgment and\n\n     decree dated 12th of December, 2007 passed by a\n\n     learned Judge of the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi\n\n     in RSA No.136 of 2004. By the impugned judgment,\n\n     the High Court had reduced the mesne profits granted\n\n     by the courts below from Rs.70,000/-per month to\n\n     Rs.40,000/- per month, to that extent the orders of\n\n     the courts below were modified.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                                          2</span><p id=\"p_3\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_4\">3.   It is an admitted position, the eviction order has not\n\n     been challenged. It is only against the reduction of\n\n     mesne    profits   per    month      from   Rs.70,000/-   to\n\n     Rs.40,000/- being challenged before us which on\n\n     grant of leave was heard in the presence of the learned\n\n     counsel for the parties.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">4.   In our view, the judgment of the High Court needs to\n\n     be set aside on a simple ground. That while reducing\n\n     and modifying the order of the courts below regarding\n\n     the   rate   of   mesne    profits   from   Rs.70,000/-   to\n\n     Rs.40,000/- per month, the High Court had not dealt\n\n     with the evidence         adduced    by the    parties and\n\n     considered the materials on record to come to a\n\n     conclusion that the orders of the courts below\n\n     directing Rs.70,000/- per month as mesne profits be\n\n     modified to the extent of Rs.40,000/- per month\n\n     payable to the landlord. We do not find from the\n\n     judgment that any consideration was made by the\n\n     High Court to reduce the rate of mesne profits from\n\n     Rs.70,000/- to Rs.40,000/- per month. That being the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                                              3</span>\n\n\n     position, we set aside the judgment of the High Court\n\n     and send the case back to it for fresh disposal in\n\n     accordance with law after giving hearing to the parties\n\n     and after passing a reasoned order. We request the\n\n     High Court to dispose of the second appeal within\n\n     three months from the date of supply of a copy of this\n\n     order to it.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">5.   For the reasons aforesaid, the impugned order is set\n\n     aside and the appeal is allowed to the extent indicated\n\n     above. There will be no order as to costs.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">6.   We make it clear that we have not gone into the merits\n\n     on the question of fixing the rate of mesne profits\n\n     which shall     be   decided   by the     High     Court       in\n\n     accordance with law after hearing the parties at\n\n     length.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">                                     ..............................J.\n                                     [Tarun Chatterjee]\n\n\nNew Delhi;                           ..............................J.\nFebruary 06, 2009.

From the details of the election programme it appears that the last date for\n\ngetting the nomination form is 24.2.2009 and the last date for scrutiny of the\n\nnomination form is 25.2.2009 and date of the publication of the nomination form is\n\n26.2.2009. The date of the election is 29.3.2009 and the date of counting is\n\n30.3.2009.\n\f    7. Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that apparently the name of</pre>\n\n<p id=\"p_1\">the appellant is not entitled to be included in the voter list because the cut-off date is\n\n30.6.2007 and the appellant was enrolled on 14.7.2007 i.e. after the cut-off date.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_2\">    8. Learned counsel for the appellant stated that the interpretation put by the\n\nHigh Court is not correct.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_3\">    9. We need go into this question in view of the order we propose to pass. Let\n\nthe petitioner's nomination form be scrutinized. It is open to the respondent to raise\n\nobjection about the entertainability of the nomination paper. We make it clear that we\n\nhave not expressed any opinion about the validity of the nomination form or\n\notherwise. Needless to say the objection, if any, filed by the respondent shall be\n\nconsidered in its proper perspective uninfluenced by any observations made by the\n\nHigh Court. Further, if any person has any grievance regarding the determination of\n\nvalidity, or otherwise of the nomination form available statutory remedy can be\n\navailed. The order of the High Court is set aside.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">    10.

In this\nconnection, it is stated that the Uttar Pradesh Water Supply and Sewerage Act, 1975,\nhas been amended and Section 27-A has been inserted therein which envisages\ncreation of centralised services.   Accordingly, the Government of Uttar Pradesh\ncreated a centralise service by making the Uttar Pradesh Palika and Jal Sansthan\nWaterworks Engineering (Centralised) Service Rules, 1996 [for short, \"the Rules\"].\nHence, a person, who is in the centralised service, can be transferred. Rule 3 of the\nRules states that a General Manager of the Jal Sansthan is in the centralised service.\nHence, in our opinion, the respondent, being the General Manager, could be\ntransferred in view of Rule 27, which states:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">           \"The State Government can transfer any officer of the Centralized\n           service from one Palika or Jal Sansthan to another Palika or Jal\n           Sansthan.\"\n</blockquote>                                                                                 ...2/-\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                          -2-</span>\n<p id=\"p_4\">           Accordingly, the civil appeal is allowed, impugned judgement of the High\nCourt is set aside and the writ petition filed in the High Court is dismissed.\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">           No order as to costs.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_6\">                                                                ......................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">                                                [MARKANDEY KATJU]\n\n\n\n                                                                          ......................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">                                                [G.S.

The High Court felt that there was no material to show\n\nthat the building will not withstand the second floor and that there was\n\ninconvenience on the part of the applicant before the High Court to\n\naccommodate his sons. The High Court in the aforesaid premises modified the\n\ninterim order dated 3.11.2006 and permitted construction of the second floor.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">    3. Learned counsel for the appellants assailed the correctness of the\n\nimpugned order. There was no material before the High Court to show that any\n\nplan had been submitted or there was any sanction to construct the second floor.\n\nSpecific stand was taken that the building would not withstand raising of the\n\nsecond floor. The High Court felt that it was for the appellant before the High\n\nCourt to show that the building withstand the second floor. No material was\n\nplaced by the applicant before the High Court to show that either there was any\n\fsanction for construction of the second floor or that the factual situation was that\n\nconstruction of the second floor would not cause damage to the building. Merely\n\nbecause there was some purported inconvenience indicated by the applicant that\n\ncould not have been ground to permit construction of the second floor.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">    4. In the circumstances, we set aside the impugned order of the High Court\n\ndated 20.10.2008 and direct that status quo as was earlier directed by the order\n\ndated 3.11.2006 shall continue to be operative till disposal of the matter by the\n\nHigh Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">    5. The appeal is disposed of accordingly. No costs.\n\f</p>","tid":1788951,"showurl":true,"citeList":[]}, {"numcites":0,"covertids":[],"covertitles":[],"relatedqs":[{"value":"pasayat","formInput":"pasayat"},{"value":"arijit pasayat","formInput":"arijit%20pasayat"}],"firstname":null,"title":"State By Inspector Of Police vs Sriramulu & Ors on 12 February, 2009","url":"http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgst.aspx?filename=33781","lastname":"pasayat","secondname":"a","publishdate":"2009-02-12","citedbyList":[],"covers":[],"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","numcitedby":0,"divtype":"judgments","doc":"<div class=\"docsource_main\">Supreme Court of India</div>\n<div class=\"doc_title\">State By Inspector Of Police vs Sriramulu &amp; Ors on 12 February, 2009</div><div class=\"doc_author\">Author: .

The State\nCommission, instead of deciding the complaint on merits, transferred the same to the\nDistrict Forum, as in its opinion, the amount of compensation was astronomically\nhigh.

Hence, this appeal by special\nleave.\n</p><p id=\"p_4\">          In our view, the State Commission was duty bound to consider the merits\nof the claim made by the appellants and decide the same after giving opportunity of\nadducing evidence\n                                                                               ....2/-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                         -2-</span>\n<p id=\"p_5\">to the parties and hearing them.

Subsequent to the passing of the impugned Order\n\ndated 18.9.2006 in CRP No. 896/06, the petitioner herein filed Review Application No.\n\n85/07. This application was filed in time prescribed for filing the Review Petition under\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_1\">Limitation Act</a>, 1963. However, vide Order dated 27.3.2008 the said Review\n\nApplication No. 85/07 stood rejected. This special leave petition is filed against the main\n\njudgment and final Order dated 18.9.2006 in CRP No. 896/06 on 7.7.2008. In the process,\n\nthere is a delay of 568 days in filing the special leave petition against the main judgment\n\nand order dated 18.9.2006. The delay, therefore, in filing this special leave\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                           -2-</span>\n\npetition was on account of pendency of Review Application No. 85/07 before the Madras\n\fHigh Court. Consequently, vide I.A. No.\n\n1 of 2008, the petitioner herein prays for condonation of delay of 568 days in filing this\n\nSLP against the main judgment and final Order dated 18.9.2006.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_2\">          When this special leave petition came for hearing before the earlier Division\n\nBench on 25.11.2008, a query was raised by the Court as to whether prosecution of\n\nReview Proceedings would be sufficient cause for purposes of <a href=\"/doc/100581/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 5</a> of the Limitation\n\nAct, 1963. This query was raised by the Court because in numerous matters, this Court\n\nfinds enormous delay in the filing of special leave petitions on the ground that the\n\npetitioner has been prosecuting review proceedings on which count there was delay in\n\nfiling the special leave petition. There is one more reason why this Court raised the above\n\nquery. There is divergence of opinion among Courts whether the prosecution of Review\n\nProceedings would be sufficient cause at all for purposes of <a href=\"/doc/100581/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 5</a> of the Limitation\n\nAct, 1963. For this purpose we requested Shri Shyam Diwan, learned senior counsel, to\n\nassist us in answering the query raised hereinabove.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_3\">          On the question as to whether the prosecution of a Review Application would\n\nbe a sufficient cause for not filing the special leave petition in time for the purposes of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/100581/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act, 1963 we are of the view that there is\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                           -3-</span>\n\na dichotomy between the appellate jurisdiction of this Court and discretionary\n\njurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 136</a> of the Constitution (See: <a href=\"/doc/1940266/\" id=\"a_6\">Kunhayammed and Ors. v. State\n\nof Kerala and Anr</a>. reported in (2000) 6 SCC 359). Reading the said judgment, it also\n\nbecomes clear that filing of Review Petition is no impediment to the filing of the special\n\nleave petition. Large number of judgments were cited before us by learned counsel. It is\n\fnot necessary at this stage to discuss each and every judgment cited before us for the\n\nsimple reason that <a href=\"/doc/100581/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act, 1963 does not lay down any standard\n\nor objective test. The test of \"sufficient cause\" is purely an individualistic test. It is not an\n\nobjective test. Therefore, no two cases can be treated alike. The statute of Limitation has\n\nleft the concept of \"sufficient cause\" delightfully undefined, thereby leaving to the Court\n\na well-intentioned discretion to decide the individual cases whether circumstances exist\n\nestablishing sufficient cause. There are no categories of sufficient cause. The categories of\n\nsufficient cause are never exhausted. Each case spells out a unique experience to be dealt\n\nwith by the Court as such.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">           For the aforestated reasons, we hold that in each and every case the Court has\n\nto examine whether delay in filing the special leave petition stands properly explained.\n\nThis is the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                            -4-</span>\n\nbasic test which needs to be applied. The true guide is whether the petitioner has acted\n\nwith reasonable diligence in the prosecution of his appeal/petition. In exercise of\n\ndiscretion under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 136</a> to decide whether delay should be condoned or not, this\n\nCourt is not bound by considerations applicable to an Appellate Court but nonetheless\n\ngeneral principles which would weigh with the Appellate Court in determining sufficient\n\ncause can be the guiding factor/guideline. Therefore, it cannot be stated as a proposition\n\nper se that the prosecution of Review Proceedings would not be a sufficient cause at all\n\nfor purposes of <a href=\"/doc/100581/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act, 1963.\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">\f          In the present case, as stated above, what is challenged is the main judgment\n\nand Order dated 18.9.2006.

Challenge in this appeal is to the order dated 9th July, 2007 passed by the\n\n   High Court of Judicature at Patna in Criminal Miscellaneous No.17513 of\n\n   1998.    By the impugned order, the High Court has dismissed the petition\n\n   preferred by the appellant under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal\n\n   Procedure, 1973 (for short `the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_2\">Cr.P.C</a>.'), seeking quashing of proceedings\n\n   pending against him in Special Case No. 29 of 1987 before the Special Judge,\n\n   Muzaffarpur for allegedly committing offences under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_3\">Sections 161</a> (before its\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                                  1</span>\n\f   omission by Act 30/2001), 109 and 120B<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_4\"> of the Indian Penal Code</a>, 1860 (for\n\n   short `the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_5\">I.P.C</a>.') and <a href=\"/doc/1420677/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947\n\n   (for short `the Act').\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">3. The case has a chequered history and, therefore, in order to appreciate the\n\n   rival stands of the parties, it would be necessary to notice the background\n\n   facts in a little greater detail.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">         The genesis of the case dates back to 8th April, 1981 when a search\n\noperation was conducted by the office of the Superintendent of Police, Crime\n\nInvestigation Department, (Vigilance), Muzaffarpur, on the basis of a complaint\n\nlodged by a civil contractor against the appellant, an Assistant Engineer in the\n\nBihar State Electricity Board (Civil) Muzaffarpur, for allegedly demanding a sum\n\nof Rs.1000/- as illegal gratification for release of payment for the civil work\n\nexecuted by him. In the trap laid to catch the culprit, the chemically treated\n\ncurrency notes are stated to have been recovered from appellant's pocket. As a\n\nfollow up action, after investigation by an Inspector of Police, a chargesheet for\n\nthe afore-mentioned offences was filed against the appellant on 28th February,\n\n1982.    The Magistrate took cognizance on 9th December, 1982.           Nothing\n\nsubstantial happened till 6th July, 1987 except for dismissal of an application,\n\ndated 30th June, 1983 filed by the prosecution for reinvestigation of the case,\n\nwhen the case was transferred from Muzaffarpur to Patna.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                                     2</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">\f4. On 7th December, 1990, the appellant filed a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 482</a>\n\n   Cr.P.C. before the Patna High Court against the order passed by the Special\n\n   Judge, Muzaffarpur taking cognizance of the said offences, on the ground\n\n   that the Inspector of Police, who had conducted the investigations, on the\n\n   basis whereof the chargesheet was filed, had no jurisdiction to do so.\n\n   Accepting the plea of the appellant, the High Court, vide order dated 7th\n\n   December, 1990 quashed the order of Magistrate taking cognizance, with a\n\n   direction to the prosecution to complete the investigation within a period of\n\n   three months from receipt of the order, by an officer of the rank of a Deputy\n\n   Superintendent of Police or any other officer duly authorised in this behalf.\n\n   No further progress was made in the case and the matter rested there till the\n\n   year 1998, when the appellant filed yet another petition under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 482</a>\n\n   Cr.P.C., giving rise to the present appeal, seeking quashing of the entire\n\n   criminal proceedings pending against him mainly on the ground that re-\n\n   investigation in the matter had not been initiated even after a lapse of seven\n\n   and a half years of the order passed by the High Court on 7th December, 1990\n\n   and in the process the appellant had suffered undue harassment for over\n\n   eighteen years. On 20th November, 1998, the petition was admitted to final\n\n   hearing.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">5. Ultimately, when the matter was called out for final hearing after almost nine\n\n   years, on 11th May, 2007, counsel for the vigilance department sought time to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                                    3</span>\n\f  seek instructions in regard to the stage of investigations.             In furtherance\n\n  thereof, an affidavit was filed on behalf of the prosecution, inter alia, stating\n\n  that the Superintendent of Police, Muzaffarpur vide his letter dated 22nd\n\n  February, 2007 had directed the Deputy Superintendent of Police to complete\n\n  the   investigations.   In    pursuance   of     the   said   direction,    the   Deputy\n\n  Superintendent started investigations on 28th February, 2007 and ultimately\n\n  filed a fresh chargesheet on 1st May, 2007.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">6. As noted earlier, the High Court has dismissed the petition. Acknowledging\n\n  that there has been substantial delay in conclusion of proceedings against the\n\n  appellant and some prejudice may have been caused to the appellant in his\n\n  professional career on account of continuance of criminal case against him as\n\n  he was deprived of the promotion in the meantime, the learned Judge finally\n\n  concluded that this reason by itself was not sufficient to quash the entire\n\n  criminal   proceedings       against   him,    particularly   keeping      in   view   the\n\n  seriousness of the allegations. The learned Judge, however, directed the trial\n\n  court to conduct the trial in the matter on a day to day basis and complete\n\n  the same within a period of four months. The Court also directed that if the\n\n  sanction of the State Government had not yet been obtained, the question of\n\n  grant of sanction shall be considered by the State Government within a period\n\n  of six weeks from the date of the order.               Being aggrieved by the said\n\n  decision, the appellant has preferred the present appeal.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                                               4</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">\f7. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant vehemently submitted\n\n  that though a period of about twenty eight years, since the registration of the\n\n  case against the appellant, has elapsed, the trial according to law is yet to\n\n  commence and thus, the appellant has been deprived of his constitutional\n\n  right to speedy investigation and trial flowing from <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 21</a> of the\n\n  Constitution.     It was pleaded that having regard to the prevailing\n\n  circumstances and the fact that it is still not clear whether the requisite\n\n  sanction to prosecute the appellant has been granted or not, this is eminently\n\n  a fit case where the chargesheet against the appellant ought to be quashed.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">8. Per contra, learned counsel for the State contended that in view of the\n\n  seriousness of the offences alleged against the appellant, the High Court was\n\n  fully justified in dismissing the petition by applying the correct principles to\n\n  be kept in view while exercising its inherent powers under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 482</a>\n\n  Cr.P.C. The learned counsel also submitted that the delay in trial was also, to\n\n  some extent, attributable to the appellant because it was he who had\n\n  belatedly questioned the jurisdiction of the investigating officer.         Learned\n\n  counsel also urged that the prosecution could not be held responsible for\n\n  delay in trial on account of transfer of the case from Muzaffarpur to Patna\n\n  and again from Patna to Muzaffarpur.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_17\">\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">9. Before   adverting   to   the   core   issue,   viz.   whether   under   the   given\n\n  circumstances the appellant was entitled to approach the High Court for\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                                          5</span>\n\f    getting the entire criminal proceedings against him quashed, it would be\n\n    appropriate to notice the circumstances and the parameters enunciated and\n\n    reiterated by this Court in a series of decisions under which the High Court\n\n    can exercise its inherent powers under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_11\">Sections 482</a> Cr.P.C. to prevent abuse\n\n    of process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. The power\n\n    possessed by the High Court under the said provision is undoubtedly very\n\n    wide but it has to be exercised in appropriate cases, ex debito justitiae to do real\n\n    and substantial justice for the administration of which alone the courts exist.\n\n    The inherent powers do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the High Court\n\n    to act according to whim or caprice. It is trite to state that the said powers\n\n    have to be exercised sparingly and with circumspection only where the court\n\n    is convinced, on the basis of material on record, that allowing the\n\n    proceedings to continue would be an abuse of the process of the court or\n\n    that the ends of justice require that the proceedings ought to be quashed.\n\n    [See: Kurukshetra University &amp; Anr. Vs. State of Haryana &amp; Anr.1, Janata Dal Vs. H.S.\n\n    Chowdhary &amp; Ors.2, and State of Haryana &amp; Ors. Vs. Bhajan Lal &amp; Ors.3]\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">10. In Bhajan Lal's case (supra), while formulating as many as seven categories of\n\n    cases by way of illustration, wherein the extra-ordinary power under the\n\n    afore-stated provisions could be exercised by the High Court to prevent\n\n    abuse of process of the court, it was clarified that it was not possible to lay\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">1</span>\n  (1977) 4 SCC 451\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">2</span>\n  (1992) 4 SCC 305\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">3</span>\n  1992 Supp (1) SCC 335\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                                            6</span>\n\f      down precise and inflexible guidelines or any rigid formula or to give an\n\n      exhaustive list of the circumstances in which such power could be exercised.\n\n      This view has been reiterated in a catena of subsequent decisions.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">11. We are of the opinion that having regard to the factual scenario, noted above,\n\n      and for the reasons stated hereafter, it is a fit case where the High Court\n\n      should have exercised its powers under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">12. Time and again this Court has emphasized the need for speedy investigations\n\n      and trial as both are mandated by the letter and spirit of the provisions of the\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_13\">Cr.P.C</a>. (In particular, <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_14\">Sections 197</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_15\">173</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_16\">309</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_17\">437</a> (6) and 468 etc.) and the\n\n      constitutional protection enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. Inspired\n\n      by the broad sweep and content of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 21</a> as interpreted by a seven-Judge\n\n      Bench of this Court in Maneka Gandhi Vs. Union of India &amp; Anr.4, in Hussainara\n\n      Khatoon &amp; Ors. Vs. Home Secretary, State of Bihar5, this Court had observed that\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 21</a> confers a fundamental right on every person not to be deprived of\n\n      his life or liberty except according to procedure established by law; that such\n\n      procedure is not some semblance of a procedure but the procedure should\n\n      be 'reasonable, fair and just'; and therefrom flows, without doubt, the right to\n\n      speedy trial. It was also observed that no procedure which does not ensure a\n\n      reasonably quick trial can be regarded as 'reasonable, fair or just' and it\n\n      would fall foul of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 21.</a>   The Court clarified that speedy trial means\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">4</span>\n    (1978) 1 SCC 248\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">5</span>\n    (1980) 1 SCC 81\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                                                         7</span>\n\f      reasonably expeditious trial which is an integral and essential part of the\n\n      fundamental right to life and liberty enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 21.</a>\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">13. The exposition of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 21</a> in Hussainara Khatoon's case (supra) was\n\n      exhaustively considered afresh by the Constitution Bench in Abdul Rehman\n\n      Antulay &amp; Ors. Vs. R.S. Nayak &amp; Anr.6. Referring to a number of decisions of this\n\n      Court and the American precedents on the Sixth Amendment of their\n\n      Constitution, making the right to a speedy and public trial a constitutional\n\n      guarantee, the Court formulated as many as eleven propositions with a note\n\n      of caution that these were not exhaustive and were meant only to serve as\n\n      guidelines. For the sake of brevity, we do not propose to reproduce all the\n\n      said propositions and it would suffice to note the gist thereof. These are: (i)\n\n      fair, just and reasonable procedure implicit in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution\n\n      creates a right in the accused to be tried speedily; (ii) right to speedy trial\n\n      flowing from <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 21</a> encompasses all the stages, namely the stage of\n\n      investigation, inquiry, trial, appeal, revision and retrial; (iii) in every case\n\n      where the speedy trial is alleged to have been infringed, the first question to\n\n      be put and answered is -- who is responsible for the delay?; (iv) while\n\n      determining whether undue delay has occurred (resulting in violation of right\n\n      to speedy trial) one must have regard to all the attendant circumstances,\n\n      including nature of offence, number of accused and witnesses, the work-load\n\n      of the court concerned, prevailing local conditions and so on--what is called,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">6</span>\n    (1992) 1 SCC 225\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                                                                          8</span>\n\fthe systemic delays; (v) each and every delay does not necessarily prejudice\n\nthe accused. Some delays may indeed work to his advantage.             However,\n\ninordinately long delay may be taken as presumptive proof of prejudice. In\n\nthis context, the fact of incarceration of accused will also be a relevant fact.\n\nThe prosecution should not be allowed to become a persecution. But when\n\ndoes the prosecution become persecution, again depends upon the facts of a\n\ngiven case; (vi) ultimately, the court has to balance and weigh several relevant\n\nfactors--'balancing test' or 'balancing process'--and determine in each case\n\nwhether the right to speedy trial has been denied; (vii) Ordinarily speaking,\n\nwhere the court comes to a conclusion that right to speedy trial of an accused\n\nhas been infringed the charges or the conviction, as the case may be, shall be\n\nquashed.     But this is not the only course open and having regard to the\n\nnature of offence and other circumstances when the court feels that quashing\n\nof proceedings cannot be in the interest of justice, it is open to the court to\n\nmake appropriate orders, including fixing the period for completion of trial;\n\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">(viii) it is neither advisable nor feasible to prescribe any outer time-limit for\n\nconclusion of all criminal proceedings. In every case of complaint of denial of\n\nright to speedy trial, it is primarily for the prosecution to justify and explain\n\nthe delay.   At the same time, it is the duty of the court to weigh all the\n\ncircumstances of a given case before pronouncing upon the complaint; (ix) an\n\nobjection based on denial of right to speedy trial and for relief on that\n\naccount, should first be addressed to the High Court. Even if the High Court\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                                                                    9</span>\n\f    entertains such a plea, ordinarily it should not stay the proceedings, except in\n\n    a case of grave and exceptional nature. Such proceedings in the High Court\n\n    must, however, be disposed of on a priority basis.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_24\">\n</p><p id=\"p_25\">14. Notwithstanding elaborate enunciation of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution in\n\n    Abdul Rehman Antulay (supra), and rejection of the fervent plea of proponents of\n\n    right to speedy trial for laying down time-limits as bar beyond which a\n\n    criminal trial shall not proceed, pronouncements of this Court in \"Common\n\n    Cause\" A Registered Society Vs. Union of India (UOI) &amp; Ors.7, \"Common Cause\", A\n\n    Registered Society Vs. Union of India &amp; Ors.8, Raj Deo Sharma Vs. State of Bihar9 and Raj\n\n    Deo Sharma II Vs. State of Bihar10 gave rise to some confusion on the question\n\n    whether an outer time limit for conclusion of criminal proceedings could be\n\n    prescribed whereafter the trial court would be obliged to terminate the\n\n    proceedings and necessarily acquit or discharge the accused. The confusion\n\n    on the issue was set at rest by a seven-Judge Bench of this court in P.\n\n    Ramachandra Rao Vs. State of Karnataka11. Speaking for the majority, R.C. Lahoti,\n\n    J. (as his Lordship then was) while affirming that the dictum in A.R. Antulay's\n\n    case (supra) as correct and the one which still holds the field and the\n\n    propositions emerging from <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and expounding\n\n    the right to speedy trial laid down as guidelines in the said case adequately\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">7</span>\n  (1996) 4 SCC 33\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">8</span>\n  (1996) 6 SCC 775\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">9</span>\n  (1998) 7 SCC 507\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">10</span>\n   (1999) 7 SCC 604\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">11</span>\n   (2002) 4 SCC 578\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                                                                                10</span>\n\f   take care of right to speedy trial, it was held that guidelines laid down in the\n\n   A.R. Antulay's case (supra) are not exhaustive but only illustrative. They are not\n\n   intended to operate as hard and fast rules or to be applied as a strait-jacket\n\n   formula. Their applicability would depend on the fact-situation of each case\n\n   as it is difficult to foresee all situations and no generalization can be made. It\n\n   has also been held that it is neither advisable, nor feasible, nor judicially\n\n   permissible to draw or prescribe an outer limit for conclusion of all criminal\n\n   proceedings. Nonetheless, the criminal courts should exercise their available\n\n   powers such as those under <a href=\"/doc/1645292/\" id=\"a_28\">Sections 309</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1780550/\" id=\"a_29\">311</a> and <a href=\"/doc/729109/\" id=\"a_30\">258</a> of Cr.P.C. to\n\n   effectuate the right to speedy trial. In appropriate cases, jurisdiction of the\n\n   High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. and Articles 226 and 227 of the\n\n   Constitution can be invoked seeking appropriate relief or suitable directions.\n\n   The outer limits or power of limitation expounded in the aforenoted\n\n   judgments were held to be not in consonance with the legislative intent.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_26\">15. It is, therefore, well settled that the right to speedy trial in all criminal\n\n   persecutions is an inalienable right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. This\n\n   right is applicable not only to the actual proceedings in court but also\n\n   includes within its sweep the preceding police investigations as well.        The\n\n   right to speedy trial extends equally to all criminal prosecutions and is not\n\n   confined to any particular category of cases. In every case, where the right to\n\n   speedy trial is alleged to have been infringed, the court has to perform the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                                                                        11</span>\n\f  balancing act upon taking into consideration all the attendant circumstances,\n\n  enumerated above, and determine in each case whether the right to speedy\n\n  trial has been denied in a given case.       Where the court comes to the\n\n  conclusion that the right to speedy trial of an accused has been infringed, the\n\n  charges or the conviction, as the case may be, may be quashed unless the\n\n  court feels that having regard to the nature of offence and other relevant\n\n  circumstances, quashing of proceedings may not be in the interest of justice.\n\n  In such a situation, it is open to the court to make an appropriate order as it\n\n  may deem just and equitable including fixation of time frame for conclusion\n\n  of trial.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_27\">\n</p><p id=\"p_28\">16. Tested on the touchstone of the broad principles enumerated above, we are\n\n  convinced that in the present case appellant's constitutional right recognised\n\n  under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution stands violated. It is manifest from the\n\n  facts narrated above that in the first instance investigations were conducted\n\n  by an officer, who had no jurisdiction to do so and the appellant cannot be\n\n  accused of delaying the trial merely because he successfully exercised his\n\n  right to challenge an illegal investigation. Be that as it may, admittedly the\n\n  High Court vide its order dated 7th September, 1990 had directed the\n\n  prosecution to complete the investigation within a period of three months\n\n  from the date of the said order but nothing happened till 27th February, 2007\n\n  when, after receipt of notice in the second petition preferred by the appellant\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                                                                    12</span>\n\fcomplaining about delay in investigation, the Superintendent of Police,\n\nMuzaffarpur directed the Deputy Superintendent of Police to complete the\n\ninvestigation. It was only thereafter that a fresh chargesheet is stated to have\n\nbeen filed on 1st May, 2007. It is also pertinent to note that even till date,\n\nlearned counsel for the State is not sure whether a sanction for prosecuting\n\nthe appellant is required and if so, whether it has been granted or not. We\n\nhave no hesitation in holding that at least for the period from 7th December,\n\n1990 till 28th February, 2007 there is no explanation whatsoever for the delay\n\nin investigation. Even the direction issued by the High Court seems to have\n\nhad no effect on the prosecution and they slept over the matter for almost\n\nseventeen years. Nothing could be pointed out by the State, far from being\n\nestablished to show that the delay in investigation or trial was in any way\n\nattributable to the appellant.    The prosecution has failed to show any\n\nexceptional circumstance which could possibly be taken into consideration\n\nfor condoning a callous and inordinate delay of more than two decades in\n\ninvestigations and the trial. The said delay cannot, in any way, be said to be\n\narising from any default on the part of the appellant. Thus, on facts in hand,\n\nin our opinion, the stated delay clearly violates the constitutional guarantee\n\nof a speedy investigation and trial under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. We\n\nfeel that under these circumstances, further continuance of criminal\n\nproceedings, pending against the appellant in the court of Special Judge,\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                                                                   13</span>\n\f   Muzaffarpur, is unwarranted and despite the fact that allegations against him\n\n   are quite serious, they deserve to be quashed.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_29\">\n</p><p id=\"p_30\">17.

Allegedly, on 2.3.2000, the Inspector General of Police requested the\n\nHome Department of the Government of Assam to obtain sanction of the\n\nState Level Empowered Committee for appointment of 174 Sub-Inspector\n\nof Police pursuant whereto the Home Department accorded sanction\n\ntherefor.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">7.

However, it appears\n\nthat during the currency of the life of the select list, the Director General of\n\nPolice, by a letter dated 21.12.2000, addressed to the Commissioner-\n\nSecretary to the Home Department, Dispur, asked for sanction of the State\n\nLevel Empowered Committee (SLEC) to fill up 77 additional vacancies that\n\nhad arisen from the aforementioned select list, stating :\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                    5</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">             \"I am writing to inform you that presently, there\n             are 2154 number of vacancies in the rank of\n             constables (Battalion 1136, District AB 504,\n             District UB 514) and 77 Nos. of vacancies in the\n             rank of S.Is in the Assam Police.

Allegedly, urgency and compelling reasons for which the said\n\nvacancies were to be filled up was vast deteriorating law and order situation\n\nin the State as also sudden spurt of extremists related incidents of violence.\n\nIt was furthermore stated that in the Brahmaputra vally, the ULFA and the\n\nNDFB had intensified their subversive activities and resorted to widespread\n\nkilling and extortion spree in the hill district of Karbi Anglong and the NC\n\nHills where the UPDS and DHD had already been active.                 It was\n\nfurthermore contended that the NSCN (IM) and the Kuki militants also\n\nresorted to sporadic acts of violence in the said two districts. According to\n\nthe State, during the period 1.7.2000 to 31.12.2000 356 extremists related\n\nincidents took place and between the period 1.1.2001 to 30.6.2001, 259\n\nsuch incidents took place wherein a large number of civilians, force\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                    6</span>\n\npersonnel and extremists were killed.

An office note was thereafter put up for consideration of the Director\n\nGeneral of Police in respect of 88 vacancies which had arisen by that time in\n\nthe rank of Sub-Inspector of Police. Approval was sought for from the\n\nDirector General of Police as to whether the said vacancies be filled up from\n\namongst the candidates whose names appear in the aforementioned select\n\nlist from Serial No.175 onwards as the list had already been acted upon upto\n\nserial No.174. The Director General of Police is said to have accorded the\n\nnecessary approval.     Pursuant thereto, the Home Commissioner was\n\nrequested to sanction 80 posts in the existing vacancies in the State in place\n\nof 77 vacancies. The said select list was again published on 8.1.2001. 84\n\ncandidates out of the said select list were asked to appear in the physical\n\nability test on 22.1.2001. Three candidates failed to appear in the physical\n\ntest and four others failed to clear the physical test and therafter 77\n\ncandidates were called to appear for the medical test on 25.1.20001 out of\n\nwhich 75 candidates were found suitable for appointment. The Deputy\n\nSecretary to the Government of Assam, Home Department, thereafter by a\n\nletter dated 20.2.2001 conveyed the sanction of the SLEC for direct\n\nrecruitment in respect of 80 vacancies to the post of Sub-Inspector of Police,\n\nstating :\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                    7</span><p id=\"p_20\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">            \"In inviting a reference to your letter cited above, I\n            am directed to inform you that the Personnel (B)\n            Department has obtained and conveyed the\n            clearance of the SLEC for direct recruitment of 80\n            (UB) Sub-Inspector of Police by observing\n            necessary formalities as required in this regard.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">                  This issue as per endorsement of the\n            Personnel (B) Department communicated vide\n            their consulted U/O No.141/2001, dated\n            17.2.2001.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_21\">10.

Indisputably, during pendency of the said writ petition, posts were\n\nfilled up as 75 persons who had been found suitable were offered\n\nappointment to the post of Sub-Inspector of Police on 2.3.2001.       The\n\nrespondents who were 74 in number had accepted the said offer of\n\nappointment on 3.3.2001; one of them, however, did not join the post. They\n\nwere sent for and completed their training. Indisputably, they have been\n\nworking in the said post.     By reason of a judgment and order dated\n\n12.2.2004 a learned Single Judge of the said Court, however, set aside the\n\nappointment of 54 candidates, opining :\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_23\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">            \"Surely, if the physical test constituted a\n            competitive component of the selection process,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                    8</span>\n\n            calling the 84/76 persons for the physical test on\n            the basis of the marks secured by them in the\n            written test and oral interview and in ignoring the\n            petitioners was fatal. All the candidates were not\n            judged by a uniform process; those appointed and\n            those left out were assessed by two different\n            yardsticks, discrimination, therefore, is writ large.\n            The possibility of the petitioners, who were not\n            appointed being placed higher than those\n            eventually appointed had the petitioners also been\n            assigned marks in the physical test cannot be ruled\n            out, particularly, when the records produced reveal\n            that the difference of the total marks secured by\n            the candidates in the written test and oral\n            interview was exceedingly small. Illustratively,\n            note may be taken of the fact that not only a large\n            number of candidates secured the same marks, the\n            first of the 84 candidates called for the physical\n            test had secured 147 marks in the written test and\n            oral interview whereas the last candidate out of the\n            group of 84/76 called for the physical test had\n            secured 146 marks. The petitioner in WP (C)\n            No.628/01, who secured the 750th position,\n            secured 124 marks, i.e., a difference of only 22\n            marks in comparison to the last of the candidate\n            appointed. The possibility of an entirely different\n            picture emerging, if the petitioners have been\n            called for the physical test, therefore, looms large.\n            For the aforesaid reasons, this Court has no\n            hesitation in reaching the conclusion that the\n            fundamental rights of the petitioners under\n            Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution have been\n            infringed by the procedure adopted.

However,\n\neven prior thereto, i.e. on 24.6.2006 in terms of the judgment of the Division\n\nBench of the High Court, an advertisement was issued in a local daily \"The\n\nAssam Tribune\".      Indisputably, appellant with others appeared in the\n\nphysical test, of course, without prejudice to his rights and contentions\n\nherein.

Mr. Raju Ramachandran, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf\n\nof the appellant, would submit that the Division Bench of the High Court\n\ncommitted a serious error in passing the impugned judgment in so far as it\n\nfailed to take into consideration the importance of holding a physical test\n\nbefore preparation of the select list.     The learned counsel urged that\n\narbitrariness on the part of the Selection Committee is apparent from the\n\nfact that the order of holding tests kept on changing as the physical ability\n\ntest was pushed to the background. It was furthermore submitted that the\n\nDivision Bench of the High Court did not assign sufficient and cogent\n\nreasons for interfering with the well considered judgment of the learned\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                    11</span>\n\nSingle Judge and proceeded to modify the same without any applicant of\n\nmind.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_29\">\n</p><p id=\"p_30\">        Our attention was moreover drawn to the fact that the purported\n\nreasons for modification which were enumerated in paragraph 12 of the\n\nimpugned judgment really contain the statement of facts and, thus, the same\n\nis wholly unsustainable.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_31\">\n</p><p id=\"p_32\">15.     Mr. P.K.

Mr. Manish Goswami, learned counsel appearing on behalf of\n\nrespondent No.157, Rajesh Kumar Das, would draw our attention to the fact\n\nthat the said respondent was an NCC candidate and as such was entitled to a\n\npreferential treatment. He, having been ignored, filed a writ petition being\n\nWP(C) No.1757 of 2000 and by an order dated 7.4.2000, a learned Judge of\n\nthe High Court passed an interim order to the following effect :\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                    12</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">             \"Mr. Uzir, learned counsel for the petitioner\n             submitted that an advertisement was published\n             inviting applications for filling up of vacant posts\n             of Sub-Inspector (UB), Assam Police Force and it\n             was clearly stated in the advertisement that\n             preference will be given to those candidates who\n             possess N.C.C. `C' certificate.

It is stated that pursuant thereto and in furtherance thereof only the\n\nsaid respondent had been appointed and had been working since then. Our\n\nattention was furthermore drawn to the fact that against the order of the\n\nlearned Single Judge, a writ appeal had been filed by him which is pending.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_38\">18.   Indisputably in the advertisement, the candidates were required not\n\nonly to qualify in the written test but also the physical ability test. A plain\n\nreading of the advertisement clearly goes to show that the interview was to\n\nbe conducted only after holding of the said two tests.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_39\">19.   In tune with the said requirements only, the candidates were asked to\n\nappear in the written test on 25/26.4.1998 and in the physical test on\n\n27/28.4.1998.   There cannot, however, be any doubt whatsoever that a\n\nSelection Committee in a given situation, may lay down a procedure for the\n\npurpose of short listing the candidates but that does not mean that for the\n\nsaid purpose the order of holding a requisite test would be changed. In\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                    14</span>\n\nterms of a decision which was taken on 7.4.1999, the Selection Committee\n\nthought to take interview prior to holding of the physical ability test.\n\nPhysical ability test keeping in view the nature of the job required to be\n\nperformed by the candidates was an extremely important one. Passing in\n\nthe physical ability test is a sine qua non for selection of the candidates in\n\nthe post of Sub-Inspector of Police. It was indeed a competitive test. The\n\nmerit list, thus, should have been prepared not only on the basis of the\n\nwritten test and interview but also the physical ability test. The Selection\n\nCommittee, in our opinion, committed a serious error in changing the order\n\nof holding the tests. The learned Single Judge, therefore, was correct in\n\narriving at a conclusion that physical ability test should have been held prior\n\nto holding of the interview.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_40\">\n</p><p id=\"p_41\">20.   The question which, however, arises for consideration is as to\n\nwhether despite the same, we, in exercise of our jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_1\">Article\n\n136</a> of the Constitution of India, should interfere with the impugned\n\njudgment. Appellant concededly did not question the appointment 169\n\ncandidates. It is idle to contend that he was not aware thereof.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_42\">      If he was to challenge the validity and/or legality of the entire select\n\nlist in its entirety, he should have also questioned the recruitment of 169\n\ncandidates which took place as far back as on 4.7.2000.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">\f                                      15</span>\n\n</p><p id=\"p_43\">       Appellant was aware of his position in the select list.

Appellant, in our opinion, having accepted the change in the selection\n\nprocedure sub silentio, by not questioning the appointment of 169\n\ncandidates, in our considered opinion, cannot now be permitted to turn\n\nround and contend that the procedure adopted was illegal. He is estopped\n\nand precluded from doing so.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_46\">       <a href=\"/doc/634160/\" id=\"a_2\">In Ashok Kumar Yadav and Others v.

So far as the post of a Sub-Inspector is\n\nconcerned, he not only must have educational qualification as prescribed in\n\nthe advertisement but also must have a good presence of mind and other\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">\f                                     16</span>\n\nqualities to meet the exigencies of situation.

In the absence\n             of a fixed norm, there could be no uniformity in\n             assessing suitability of candidates in the viva voce\n             test. The Commission had therefore power to fix\n             the norm and in the instant case it had fixed 35 per\n             cent minimum marks for viva voce test.

Effective steps for\n\nfilling up the said posts by holding written examinations and interview were\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">\f                                     18</span>\n\ntaken only in 1998 onwards.         Appointments could be made of 169\n\ncandidates only on or about 4.7.2000. It is not in dispute that for filling up\n\nthe post of 112 vacancies about 6,000/- candidates applied. Processing of\n\ntheir applications and holding of written examination, viva voce\n\nexamination and physical ability test took a long time. At the first stage of\n\nthe recruitment process, 57 posts more than advertised 112 posts were filled\n\nup. Appellant did not question the legality and/or validity thereof. He\n\nshould have done the same at the earliest possible opportunity. Having\n\nregard to the emergent situation, in regard whereto we have taken note of\n\nearlier, proposal was made to increase the number of vacancies from time to\n\ntime.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_56\">\n</p><p id=\"p_57\">23.     The State in an emergent situation would subject to constitutional\n\nlimitations is entitled to take a decision which subserve a greater public\n\ninterest.   While saying so, we are not unmindful of the fact that the\n\nConstitution also demands that candidates who had acquired eligibility for\n\nrecruitment to the post in the meantime should also be given opportunities\n\nto participate in the selection process. This Court times without number had\n\nlamented the lackadaisical attitude on the part of the State to treat the matter\n\nof selection for appointment to services in a casual and cavalier manner. If\n\nno appointment could be made from 1997 to 2001, it is the State alone who\n\ncould thank itself therefor, but, unless there exists a constitutional or a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">\f                                    19</span>\n\nstatutory interdict so as to compel the Superior Court to set aside the\n\nselection which has otherwise been validly made; in exercise of their power\n\nof judicial review the same would not ordinarily be interfered therewith.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_58\">24.   Mr. Raju Ramachandran has strongly relied upon a judgment of this\n\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/45769/\" id=\"a_7\">Union of India and Others v. B. Valluvan and Others</a> [(2006) 8\n\nSCC 686]. This Court therein opined that the life of a panel ordinarily is\n\none year.   Therein this Court noticed this Court's earlier's decision in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1574135/\" id=\"a_8\">Surinder Singh v. State of Punjab</a> [(1997) 8 SCC 488] to hold:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">                \"17. The life of a panel ordinarily is one year.\n            The same can be extended only by the State and\n            that too if the statutory rule permits it to do so.\n            The High Court ordinarily would not extend the\n            life of a panel. Once a panel stands exhausted\n            upon filling up of all the posts, the question of\n            enforcing a future panel would not arise. It was for\n            the State to accept the said recommendations of\n            the Selection Committee or reject the same. As has\n            been noticed hereinbefore, all notified vacancies\n            as also the vacancy which arose in 2000 had also\n            been filled up.     As the future vacancy had\n            already been filled up in the year 2000, the\n            question of referring back to the panel prepared in\n            the year 1999 did not arise. The impugned\n            judgment, therefore, cannot be sustained.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">      In that case, however, it was held:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">               \"11. The Review Bench of the High Court\n            posed unto itself a wrong question. It did not say\n            how an error apparent on the face of the record\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">\f                                     20</span>\n\n             had been committed. It did not assign sufficient or\n             cogent reason to hold as to how the original\n             application before the Tribunal would have been\n             maintainable if the petitioners had no existing\n             legal right. The 1st respondent did not have any\n             legal right to be appointed. He filed an application\n             pursuant to the said advertisement. It is not his\n             case that his application had not been considered.\n             He did not raise any plea of unfair treatment. No\n             mala fide was also alleged.\"\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">      In that case, the posts more than advertised were filled up.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_59\">25.   Yet again in <a href=\"/doc/406742/\" id=\"a_9\">State of Bihar and Others v. Amrendra Kumar Mishra</a>\n\n[(2006) 12 SCC 561], this Court took the same view, stating:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">                \"Life of a panel, it is well known, remains valid\n             for a year.

Appellants herein pursuant to or in furtherance of a requisition made\n\nby the State of Kerala before the Kerala Public Service Commission (for\n\nshort, \"the Commission\") applied for the post of Lower Primary/Upper\n\nPrimary School Assistants. On 5.6.1997, the Commission prepared a rank\n\nlist, which was in force from 5.6.1997 to 5.6.2000.       Appellants' name\n\nfigured therein.    The vacancies, however, were not filled up. However, as\n\nno vacancy was filled up by the Deputy Director of Education, writ petitions\n\nwere filed before the Kerala High Court praying for issuance of a writ of\n\nmandamus or any other writ or order directing the Deputy Director of\n\nEducation to report all the vacancies to the Commission so as to enable it to\n\nadvise the respective candidates pursuant whereto and in furtherance\n\nwhereof the appointing authority may issue offers of appointment.

At this stage, I consider it necessary to\n              advert to the contention of the standing counsel of\n              the Commission that after the expiry of Ext. P1\n              rank list a new list has come into operation and\n              therefore candidates included in Ext. P1 rank list\n              cannot be advised for appointment. I cannot agree\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                    4</span>\n\n            to the above argument of the learned counsel. 175\n            vacancies were reported to the Commission before\n            the expiry of Ext. P1 rank list. Since those\n            vacancies were wrongly described as anticipated\n            vacancies the Commission did not advise\n            candidates against those vacancies. Thereupon,\n            aggrieved candidates approached this Court. A\n            Division Bench of this Court directed the 1st\n            respondent to report the vacancies correctly. The\n            1st respondent, however, issued Ext. P3 order\n            without taking into account all relevant aspect. As\n            I have found that 175 vacancies already reported\n            were not anticipated vacancies but vacancies\n            which had, in fact, occurred prior to the expiry of\n            Ext. P1, candidates included in Ext. P1 are entitled\n            to be advised for appointment against those\n            vacancies. The legitimate claim of the petitioners\n            cannot be denied for the reason that during the\n            pendency of the writ petitions a new list has come\n            into operation. I am clearly of the view that what\n            is legitimately due to the candidates in Ext. P1\n            should be given to them.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      Appellants were not parties to the said writ petitions.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"p_13\">9.    The State of Kerala preferred an appeal thereagainst before the\n\nDivision Bench of the said Court, which was marked as Writ Appeal No. 53\n\nof 2005.   Before the High Court, however, appellants got themselves\n\nimpleaded as respondents 5 and 6 respectively. The said Writ Appeal was\n\nallowed by reason of the impugned judgment directing the Commission to\n\nadvise in respect of 18 of the original petitioners who had filed the writ\n\npetition bearing O.P.

The legality and/or the validity of Government Order dated\n\n15.1.2002, as noticed hereinbefore, was questioned, inter alia, on the\n\npremise that the actual vacancy position had been suppressed by the State.\n\nA finding of fact to that effect appears to have been arrived at by the learned\n\nsingle judge of the High Court in his judgment and order dated 25.8.2004,\n\nholding:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_19\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">             \"24.

I do not agree.\n             As rightly submitted by the petitioners, vacancies\n             had been reported based on the 65% set apart for\n             direct recruitment and once those vacancies fall\n             vacant consequent on the non joining duty of the\n             candidates advised for appointment, a further\n             deduction of 35% from the N.J.D. vacancies is not\n             justified.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">             25. It is not disputed that total vacancies\n             including N.J.D. vacancies reported to the\n             Commission after 5.12.1997 was 580 (barring 175\n             vacancies described as anticipated vacancies).\n             Therefore the number of unreported vacancies will\n             come to 208. When state of affairs stood as above,\n             the 2nd respondent reported 125 vacancies on\n             3.6.2000 and 50 vacancies on 5.6.2000 as directed\n             by this Court. The reporting was done with the\n             rider that the above 175 vacancies were only\n             anticipated vacancies. As I have found that there\n             were, at any rate, 208 reportable vacancies, I have\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                      7</span>\n\n             no hesitation to hold that the 2nd respondent was\n             not justified in informing the Commission that 175\n             vacancies were anticipated vacancies. Ext. P3 is\n             therefore unsustainable.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p_20\">14.   The matter might have been different, had the learned single judge as\n\nalso the Division Bench come to a conclusion that in fact there existed 125\n\nvacancies wherefor requisition was sent to the Commissioner.               The\n\nexistence of actual number of vacancies being in dispute, it is difficult for us\n\nto opine as has been contended by the learned counsel that all such\n\nvacancies existed. Before the Division Bench of the High Court, the State\n\nconceded that 18 original writ petitioners may be appointed stating that they\n\nwere the actual beneficiaries of the judgment. Such a stand on the part of\n\nthe State was accepted. The Division Bench of the High Court did not go\n\ninto the other contentions raised by the parties thereto. No factual\n\nfoundation, therefore, has been laid before us for arriving at the conclusion\n\nthat all the 125 vacancies existed.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_21\">\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">15.   There is another aspect of the matter which cannot also be lost sight\n\nof. A person does not acquire a legal right to be appointed only because his\n\nname appears in the select list.

The state as an employer has a right to fill up all the posts or not to\n\nfill them up.

Ordinarily the notification merely amounts\n             to an invitation to qualified candidates to apply for\n             recruitment and on their selection they do not\n             acquire any right to the post.

The     complainant,             Ashok        Kumar      Pattanayak,\n\n     lodged        the     First           Information        Report       at\n\n     Gopiballabhpur             PS     on    29.11.2002           at     about\n\n     8.25 a.m. alleging that on the same date at\n\n     about      7.30/8.00            a.m.      while        his        father,\n\n     Ramesh Chandra Pattanayak, was                           supervising\n\n     the work in his brick field known as Hena\n\n     Brick,      he      was    assaulted          on   the    head      from\n\n     behind with a spade (kodal),                           as a result\n\n     whereof he died instantly.

After\n\n     completion          of    investigation              the      police\n\n     submitted      charge-sheet             against      the    accused\n\n     Laxman    Murmu.         As    there          was    no     material\n\n     against       the     appellants          herein       they       were\n\n     neither shown in the charge-sheet nor were\n\n     they sent up for trial and on the prayer\n\n     made     by     the       Investigating              Officer       the\n\n     appellants were discharged from the case by\n\n     order dated 30.6.2004.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">5.   Two years later on 22.6.2006 the trial Court\n\n     issued     warrants           of    arrest           against       the\n\n     appellants       for      their         alleged       refusal      to\n\n     receive       summons      which        had    been       issued    to\n\n     them earlier under <a href=\"/doc/435819/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 319</a> Cr.P.C. The\n\n     said order was challenged in the High Court\n\n     in its revisional             jurisdiction            and    it    was\n\n     submitted that once the appellants had been\n\n     discharged on the prayer made on behalf of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                                                  5</span>\n\n\n     the Investigating Officer, the trial Court\n\n     erred in issuing the summons under <a href=\"/doc/435819/\" id=\"a_9\">Section\n\n     319</a> of the Code on the same materials.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">6.   The High Court came to the conclusion that\n\n     there had not been any wilful defiance of\n\n     the summons which necessitated the issuance\n\n     of   warrant    of    arrest    and      disposed     of   the\n\n     revision application with a direction to the\n\n     appellants     herein      to   surrender       before     the\n\n     Court within 3 weeks from the date of the\n\n     order and thereafter to apply for bail. The\n\n     execution      of    the   warrant        of    arrest      was\n\n     stayed for a period of four weeks for the\n\n     said purpose.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">7.

In this regard, Mr. Ghosh firstly referred\n\n     to the oft-repeated decision of this Court\n\n     in    the    case       of        <a href=\"/doc/1335414/\" id=\"a_19\">Michael        Machado      vs.    CBI</a>,\n\n     [2000       (3)    SCC        262]       where         the    essential\n\n     conditions for the exercise of power under\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/435819/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 319</a> of Cr.P.C. had been considered\n\n     and it was held that the power under <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_21\">Section\n\n     319</a>    vested          in     the     Court       should      be     used\n\n     sparingly and the evidence on which the same\n\n     was     to        be        invoked        should        indicate          a\n\n     reasonable         prospect           of     conviction         of    the\n\n     persons to be summoned.                      This Court went on\n\n     to    hold         that           mere      suspicion          of     the\n\n     involvement of the person concerned in the\n\n     offence was not enough, particularly when a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                                                              8</span>\n\n\n      large number of witnesses had been examined\n\n      and no evidence on which conviction could be\n\n      secured had been adduced on behalf of the\n\n      prosecution.              It     was     ultimately             observed\n\n      that    in        such    a     case     there       could        be    no\n\n      justification             for    proceeding           against          the\n\n      persons       summoned          under       <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_22\">Section        319</a>     which\n\n      would        entail            recommencing               the     whole\n\n      proceedings against the newly-added persons\n\n      and     re-examining             the        witnesses           already\n\n      examined.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">10.   Mr. Ghosh also referred to the decision of\n\n      this     Court       in        <a href=\"/doc/1945016/\" id=\"a_23\">Krishnappa           vs.     State      of\n\n      Karnataka</a>,          [2004       (7)     SCC    792]        wherein          a\n\n      similar question fell for consideration and\n\n      again    a    note        of    caution       was    sounded        with\n\n      regard       to    invocation          of     the    extraordinary\n\n      and discretionary powers under <a href=\"/doc/435819/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 319</a>\n\n      of     the        Code.          Their        Lordships,          while\n\n      observing that a person can be summoned even\n\n      though proceedings had earlier been quashed\n\n      as far as he was concerned, held that the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                                                     9</span>\n\n\n      invocation of          the    power     under    <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_25\">Section      319</a>\n\n      should not have been resorted to, since the\n\n      chances of conviction on the basis of the\n\n      evidence on record was remote.                   Holding that\n\n      the Trial Court was right in rejecting such\n\n      prayer, since the case against the appellant\n\n      had     been     quashed        nine     years        prior    to\n\n      issuance       of     summons        under      <a href=\"/doc/435819/\" id=\"a_26\">Section       319</a>\n\n      Cr.P.C., this Court held that the High Court\n\n      had erroneously             reversed    the     order    of   the\n\n      Trial    Court        even     though     the     chances      of\n\n      conviction       on    the     basis     of     the     evidence\n\n      adduced was very remote.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">11.

More than this we would not\n\n        like to say anything further at this stage.\n\n        We leave the entire matter to the discretion\n\n        of the Court concerned so that it may act\n\n        according to law.               We would, however, make\n\n        it     plain   that        the     mere    fact     that    the\n\n        proceedings         have         been     quashed     against\n\n        respondents     2     to    5     will    not     prevent   the\n\n        Court from exercising its discretion if it\n\n        is fully satisfied that a case for taking\n\n        cognizance against them has been made out on\n\n        the additional evidence led before it.'\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">13.

Appearing for the State of West Bengal, Mr.\n\n      Avijit     Bhattacharjee         referred        to     the\n\n      decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1319831/\" id=\"a_34\">Rajender Singh vs.\n\n      State of U.P</a>.

It was further observed that when\n\n      in    a    case     against      one    or     more    accused           a\n\n      Magistrate finds from the evidence adduced\n\n      that some person other than the accused was\n\n      also involved in that very offence, it was\n\n      only proper that the Magistrate should have\n\n      power to summon by joining such person as an\n\n      accused in the case.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_22\">17.   It    was    further      observed           that    the    primary\n\n      object of <a href=\"/doc/435819/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 319</a> Cr.P.C. is that the\n\n      whole case against all the accused should be\n\n      tried        and         disposed            of       not       only\n\n      expeditiously, but also simultaneously.                            The\n\n      power       under      <a href=\"/doc/435819/\" id=\"a_41\">Section     319</a>       Cr.P.C.        must     be\n\n      regarded         and   considered        as       incidental       and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">\f                                                                          1</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                                                          5</span>\n      ancillary       to        the    main      power        to        take\n\n      cognizance as part of the normal process in\n\n      the administration of justice and that the\n\n      same    could        be     exercised       either           on     an\n\n      application      made       to   the      Court    or    by        the\n\n      Court suo moto and it was in the discretion\n\n      of the Court to take action under the said\n\n      Section     having         regard    to     the     facts          and\n\n      circumstances of each case.                  Mr. Puri also\n\n      urged that the decision of the High Court\n\n      could   not     be    faulted       and    the     appeal          was\n\n      liable to be dismissed.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_23\">18.   The common thread in most matters where the\n\n      use of discretion is in issue is that in the\n\n      exercise of such discretion each case has to\n\n      be considered on its own set of facts and\n\n      circumstances.              In    matters         relating         to\n\n      invocation of powers under <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 319</a>, the\n\n      Court is not merely required to take note of\n\n      the fact that the name of a person who has\n\n      not been named as an accused in the F.I.R.\n\n      has surfaced during the trial, but the Court\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">\f                                                                             1</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                                                             6</span>\n      is also required          to    consider           whether        such\n\n      evidence would be sufficient to convict the\n\n      person being summoned.                 Since          issuance         of\n\n      summons under <a href=\"/doc/435819/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 319</a> Cr.P.C. entails a\n\n      denovo trial and a large number of witnesses\n\n      may     have     been    examined           and        their          re-\n\n      examination could prejudice the prosecution\n\n      and delay the trial, the Trial Court has to\n\n      exercise such discretion with great care and\n\n      perspicacity.            Although,                a         somewhat\n\n      discordant       note     was        struck           in    Rajender\n\n      Singh's case (supra) the views expressed in\n\n      the majority of decisions of this Court on\n\n      the   point    subscribe        to    the     view         that       the\n\n      power    under    <a href=\"/doc/435819/\" id=\"a_44\">Section       319</a>    Cr.P.C.             is    to   be\n\n      invoked, not as a matter of course, but in\n\n      circumstances where the invocation of such\n\n      power    is    imperative       to     meet       the       ends       of\n\n      justice.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_24\">19.

In the instant case, on the quality of the\n\n      evidence adduced by the prosecution as far\n\n      as   the    appellants            are     concerned,         it    is\n\n      difficult        to     hold       with     any     amount         of\n\n      certainty        that       the     same     would          in    all\n\n      probability secure a conviction against the\n\n      appellants.

The law\n\n      in this regard was explained in Ram Kishan\n\n      Rastogi's case (supra) and as pointed out by\n\n      Mr. Ghosh, consistently followed thereafter,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">\f                                                                        1</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                                                        8</span>\n      except    for     the    note     of    discord       struck      in\n\n      Rajender Singh's case (supra).

Ram Prasad Varma, respondent No. 1, an Assistant Executive\n\nEngineer, was employed with Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) at\n\nRajahmundry. On or about 9.9.1998, while he was going to the workshop,\n\nhe was hit by a lorry bearing registration No. AP-16-W-5839. The lorry ran\n\nover his legs. He was admitted in the hospital. Indisputably, both his legs\n\nwere amputated. The fact that an accident had taken place owing to rash\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                           2</span>\n\nand negligent driving on the part of the driver of the said lorry is not in\n\ndispute. It is also not in dispute that, at the relevant time, respondent was\n\naged 55 years and his annual income was Rs.2,27,471.00.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">3.     Respondent having suffered permanent disability filed a Claim\n\nPetition in terms of <a href=\"/doc/136948773/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 166</a> of the Motor Vehicles Act claiming\n\ncompensation of a sum of Rs.20 lakhs; Rs.50,000/- towards extra\n\nnourishment; Rs. 50,000/- towards compensation for mental agony, pain and\n\nsuffering; Rs. 50,000/- for loss of amenities in life and Rs.2 lakhs for the\n\nexpenditure of attendant throughout the life and Rs.16.50 lakhs towards loss\n\nof future earnings.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">4.     The Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal awarded a sum of\n\nRs.19,63,000/- with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of\n\nfiling of the petition till realization.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">5.     An appeal preferred thereagainst by the Insurance Company before\n\nthe High Court in terms of <a href=\"/doc/147367599/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 173</a> of the Act has been dismissed by\n\nreason of the impugned judgment. The High Court, however, considering\n\nthe prevailing rate of interest reduced the rate of interest from 12% per\n\nannum to 9% per annum.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                      3</span><p id=\"p_11\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">6.    Mr. Pankaj Seth, learned counsel appearing on behalf of appellant\n\nwould contend:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      (i)     The learned Tribunal, and consequently the High Court,\n\n              committed a serious error in applying multiplier of eight\n\n              although respondent would have retired from services on\n\n              attaining the age of sixty.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      (ii)    The Tribunal in determining the amount of compensation\n\n              should have deducted the amount of income tax from his gross\n\n              salary as compensation has been granted on the basis of the\n\n              structured formula.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      (iii)   The Tribunal in determining the said amount of compensation\n\n              should have deducted one-third from the total amount of his\n\n              income by way of miscellaneous expenses.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"p_14\">7.    Indisputably, the respondent was an Assistant Executive Engineer.\n\nHe was an income tax payee. He had submitted income tax return for the\n\nyear 1998-99 showing his gross salary at Rs.2,27,471.40 and the amount of\n\nincome-tax deducted at source was Rs.30,748.00.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                    4</span>\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">8.    A claimant who had suffered injuries in a motor vehicle accident\n\nresulting in amputation of both legs is entitled to 100% compensation in\n\nterms of the First Schedule appended to the Workmen's <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_3\">Compensation Act</a>,\n\n1923. The amount of compensation which represents the loss of income can\n\nbe calculated either in terms of the structured formula as contained in the\n\nSecond Schedule appended to the <a href=\"/doc/785258/\" id=\"a_4\">Motor Vehicles Act</a> or on the basis of the\n\nother materials brought on record. It is not in dispute that in a case of this\n\nnature, the Tribunal cannot be said to have committed any illegality in\n\napplying the structured formula.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">9.    The Second Schedule as such may not have any application as the\n\nmaximum annual income of a deceased or an injured which could be taken\n\ninto consideration therefor is Rs.40,000/- per annum. However, keeping in\n\nview the peculiar factual circumstances of the case, the proper multiplier\n\nwhich, in our opinion, should be adopted is eight for the purpose of\n\ndetermining fair compensation.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_18\">\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">10.   Indisputably, he was to retire within a few years, but in view of the\n\ninjuries suffered he had to give up his job. The life expectancy of an Indian\n\ncitizen is about 62 years. A person on retirement, in the event if pension\n\nscheme is applicable, would be entitled to pensionary benefits. Had the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                    5</span>\n\nrespondent worked for five years more, the amount of pension calculated on\n\nthe basis of last pay drawn would have been more than what might have\n\nbecome payable in the year 1998.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_20\">\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">11.   One-third amount is deducted from computation of compensation\n\nfrom the total income on the premise that some expenses were necessary for\n\none's own survival. Incidentally, we may notice that in the note appended\n\nto the Second Schedule, the amount of compensation arrived in the case of\n\nfatal accident claims is required to be reduced by one-third in consideration\n\nof the expenses which the victim would have incurred towards maintaining\n\nhimself had he been alive. A person, although alive, but when he is not in a\n\nposition to move and even for every small thing he has to depend upon the\n\nservices of another, in our opinion, a direction to deduct 1/3rd of the amount\n\nfrom his total income need not always be insisted upon.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">12.   Our attention, however, has been drawn to a decision of this Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1332665/\" id=\"a_5\">New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Charlie and Anr</a>. [(2005) 10 SCC 720]\n\nwherein 1/3rd was directed to be deducted towards personal expenditure, we\n\ndo not find that any legal principle was laid down therein. It also does not\n\nappear that the premise on which such deduction is allowed and what would\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                     6</span>\n\nhappen in a case, where such a premise does not exist, did not fall for\n\nconsideration.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_23\">\n</p><p id=\"p_24\">      In Charlie (supra), this court itself opined that in a case, where the\n\ninjured had suffered 100% disability, the legal principle for determination of\n\ncompensation applicable to a deceased can, in appropriate cases, taking note\n\nof all relevant factors be reasonably applied even in a case of totally\n\npermanent disabled person.      This Court referred to Halsbury's Laws of\n\nEngland, Volume 34, para 98 wherein it was held that the multiplier may be\n\nincreased where the plaintiff is a high tax payer. That principle is also\n\napplicable in this case.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_25\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_26\">      In Halsbury (supra), it was stated that in applying the structured\n\nformula it is assumed that the return on fixed interest bearing securities is so\n\nmuch higher than 4 to 5 per cent that rough and ready allowance for\n\ninflation is thereby made.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_27\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_28\">      It was stated:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_29\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">             \"14.   The multiplier method involves the\n             ascertainment of the loss of dependency or the\n             multiplicand having regard to the circumstances of\n             the case and capitalizing the multiplicand by an\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                   7</span>\n\n            appropriate multiplier. The choice of the multiplier\n            is determined by the age of the deceased (or that of\n            the claimants whichever is higher) and by the\n            calculation as to what capital sum, if invested at a\n            rate of interest appropriate to a stable economy,\n            would yield the multiplicand by way of annual\n            interest. In ascertaining this, regard should also be\n            had to the fact that ultimately the capital sum\n            should also be consumed-up over the period for\n            which the dependency is expected to last.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_30\">13.   Our attention has also been drawn to a recent decision of this Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1989786/\" id=\"a_6\">Sunil Kumar vs. Ram Singh Gaud &amp; Ors</a>. [2007 (12) SCALE 792] wherein\n\na Division Bench has opined as under:-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_31\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">            \"9. Taking into consideration the present\n            income of the appellant as Rs.4,000/- per month;\n            and the permanent disability of 45% suffered by\n            him, we are of the view that the capacity of the\n            appellant to earn in future would be reduced by\n            Rs.1,800/- per month approximately. If 1/3rd is\n            deducted towards miscellaneous expenses, the loss\n            of income comes to Rs.1,200/- per month which,\n            in turn, comes to Rs.14,400/- per annum.\n            Appellant was 29 years of age at the time of\n            accident. Taking the multiplier to be 18 [as per the\n            Second Schedule to <a href=\"/doc/22871263/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 163A</a> of the Act], the\n            total loss of income comes to Rs.2,59,200/-.\"</blockquote><p id=\"p_32\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                   8</span>\n\n</p><p id=\"p_33\">       In that case, the injured suffered permanent disability of 45%. Even\n\ntherein the multiplier of 18 was applied. It was held that by reason of\n\ndisability suffered by the claimant his earning capacity would be reduced.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_34\">      In the instant case, respondent has become totally immobile.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_35\">14.   Our attention has also been drawn to a decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/35549/\" id=\"a_8\">Bijoy\n\nKumar Dugar v. Bidyadhar Dutta and Ors</a>. [(2006) 3 SCC 242]. In that\n\ncase, multiplier of 12 was applied. However, some observations were made\n\nthat in regard to future prospects of income in the course of employment or\n\nbusiness or profession, as the case may be, some cogent and reliable\n\nevidence have to be led.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_36\">\n</p><p id=\"p_37\">15.   In this case, respondent was a highly placed employee in a prestigious\n\npublic sector undertaking. By reason of termination of service, he is not\n\nonly deprived of his salary but also various other allowances to which he\n\nwas otherwise entitled to. His family members could have taken benefit of\n\nsome of the allowances.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_38\">\n</p><p id=\"p_39\">16.   We may, however, notice that in <a href=\"/doc/1683465/\" id=\"a_9\">General Manager, Kerala State Road\n\nTransport Corporation, Trivandrum vs. Susamma Thomas (Mrs.) &amp; ors</a>.\n\n[(1994) 2 SCC 176], this Court held:\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                        9</span><p id=\"p_40\">\n\n\"9. The assessment of damages to compensate\nthe dependants is beset with difficulties because\nfrom the nature of things, it has to take into\naccount many imponderables, e.g., the life\nexpectancy of the deceased and the dependants,\nthe amount that the deceased would have earned\nduring the remainder of his life, the amount that he\nwould have contributed to the dependants during\nthat period, the chances that the deceased may not\nhave lived or the dependants may not live up to\nthe estimated remaining period of their life\nexpectancy, the chances that the deceased might\nhave got better employment or income or might\nhave lost his employment or income altogether.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_41\">10. The manner of arriving at the damages is to\nascertain the net income of the deceased available\nfor the support of himself and his dependants, and\nto deduct therefrom such part of his income as the\ndeceased was accustomed to spend upon himself,\nas regards both self-maintenance and pleasure, and\nto ascertain what part of his net income the\ndeceased was accustomed to spend for the benefit\nof the dependants. Then that should be capitalised\nby multiplying it by a figure representing the\nproper number of year's purchase.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_42\">\n</p><p id=\"p_43\">11. Much of the calculation necessarily remains\nin the realm of hypothesis \"and in that region\narithmetic is a good servant but a bad master\"\n</p><p id=\"p_44\">since there are so often many imponderables. In\nevery case \"it is the over-all picture that matters\"\nand the court must try to assess as best as it can the\nloss suffered.\"\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                   10</span><p id=\"p_45\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_46\">17.   This aspect of the matter has also been considered in <a href=\"/doc/271657/\" id=\"a_10\">U.P. State Road\n\nTransport Corporation and Ors. v. Trilok Chandra and Ors</a>. [(1996) 4 SCC\n\n362] by a Three-Judge Bench of this Court in the following terms:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">            \"9. The compensation to be awarded has two\n            elements. One is the pecuniary loss to the estate of\n            the deceased resulting from the accident, the other\n            is the pecuniary loss sustained by the members of\n            his family for his death. The Court referred to\n            these two elements in the Gobald Motor Seivice's\n            [AIR 1962 SC 1] case. These two elements were to\n            be awarded under <a href=\"/doc/609788/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 1</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1837174/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 2</a> of the\n            Fatal Accidents Act, 1855 under which the claim\n            in that case arose.

X-Y i.e. Z, is\n                  the amount he saves every year.

Following the aforementioned precedents, we are of the opinion that\n\nin the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, it is not necessary to\n\ninterfere either with the application of multiplier of eight or non-deduction\n\nof 1/3rd from his net salary. However, what was the net salary of the\n\nrespondent for the said purpose should have been determined. An employee\n\nwhen not in employment is not to pay his tax. Income tax payable from the\n\nsalary, therefore, was required to be deducted. It was so held in <a href=\"/doc/1895620/\" id=\"a_17\">National\n\nInsurance Company Ltd. v.

This Court in Asha (supra) did not address\n      itself the questions raised before us.

What\n      would be 'just compensation' must be determined\n      having regard to the facts and circumstances of\n      each case. The basis for considering the entire pay\n      packet is what the dependents have lost due to\n      death of the deceased.

Challenge in this appeal, by special leave, is to the\n\n  judgment and order dated 26th June, 2006 passed by the\n\n  High Court of Karnataka at Bangalore, holding that the\n\n  appellants     herein   are    entitled   to a compensation    of\n\f  Rs.3,56,000/- along with interest at the rate of 6% per\n\n  annum from the date of filing of the claim petition till the\n\n  date of actual deposit of the compensation under the <a href=\"/doc/785258/\" id=\"a_1\">Motor\n\n  Vehicles Act</a>, 1988 (for short `the Act'), as against the\n\n  compensation of Rs.6,08,000/- with interest at the rate of\n\n  6% per annum, awarded by the Motor Accident Claims\n\n  Tribunal, Mysore (for short `the Tribunal') vide order dated\n\n  19th April, 2002.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">3. The appellants are the unfortunate parents and the three\n\n  sisters of the deceased. The first respondent is the owner of\n\n  the lorry, which was involved in the accident and the second\n\n  respondent is the insurance company with which the lorry\n\n  was insured. According to the appellants, on 3rd June, 1999\n\n  at about 10.00 a.m., the deceased aged about 20 years, was\n\n  riding on a luna moped when the lorry dashed against it\n\n  and ran over the deceased, killing him on the spot. It was\n\n  claimed that the deceased was engaged in his own business\n\n  under the name and style of Bharath Packing Cases\n\n  Industry, and was also dealing in cut size timber.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                            2</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">\f4. The appellants filed a petition under <a href=\"/doc/136948773/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 166</a> of the Act\n\n  for award of compensation on account of the death of the\n\n  deceased. In the petition, it was pleaded that the deceased\n\n  had   lucrative   business   and   was     earning   a   sum     of\n\n  Rs.20,000/- per month.         A claim for compensation of\n\n  Rs.68,30,000/- was made. Upon consideration of the\n\n  evidence adduced by the parties, in particular the Income\n\n  Tax Return filed by the deceased for the assessment year\n\n  1998-1999, wherein the total income from business was\n\n  declared at Rs.43,000/, the Tribunal rejected the stand of\n\n  the appellants/claimants that the earnings of deceased\n\n  were Rs.20,000/- per month. The Tribunal took the\n\n  monthly income of the deceased at Rs.7,000/- per month.\n\n  Deducting therefrom half of the said income towards\n\n  personal and living expenses of the deceased and taking the\n\n  age of the younger of the parents as the basis for\n\n  determining the multiplier as 14, the Tribunal quantified\n\n  the compensation at loss of dependency as Rs.5,88,000/-.\n\n  By adding Rs.10,000/- towards loss of expectation of life\n\n  and   Rs.10,000/-    towards     funeral    expenses     etc.,   it\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                   3</span>\n\f  determined the total compensation as Rs.6,08,000/-.         As\n\n  noted above, interest at the rate of 6% per annum was also\n\n  awarded.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">5. Being aggrieved, the owner of the vehicle, respondent No.1\n\n  in this appeal, preferred appeal to the High Court.\n\n  Rejecting the plea of the owner of the vehicle that his lorry\n\n  was not involved in the accident, the High Court came to\n\n  the conclusion that on the basis of the Income Tax Return\n\n  the income of the deceased could not be more than\n\n  Rs.40,000/- per annum.         The High Court, however,\n\n  calculated   the   monthly   income   of   the   deceased   as\n\n  Rs.4,000/-. The High Court, however, did not interfere with\n\n  the deduction towards the personal expenses and the\n\n  multiplier applied by the Tribunal as also the other\n\n  amounts awarded to the claimants. The High Court, thus,\n\n  chose to reduce the compensation amount awarded to the\n\n  appellants   by    the   Tribunal   from   Rs.6,08,000/-    to\n\n  Rs.3,56,000/- on the ground that the monthly earnings of\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                              4</span>\n\f  the deceased had been taken on the higher side at\n\n  Rs.7,000/-. Feeling aggrieved, the claimants are before us.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">6. We have heard learned counsel for the parties.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">7. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants\n\n  submitted that the High Court, while taking the monthly\n\n  income of the deceased at Rs.4,000/- per month, has\n\n  ignored other evidence brought on record by the claimants,\n\n  namely, the sale figures of his business from M/s Bharath\n\n  Packing Cases Industry for the period from 1st April, 1998 to\n\n  31st March, 1999 as reflected in the ledger accounts of one\n\n  M/s Vasu Agarbathi (Ex.P-23), one of the customers of the\n\n  deceased. It was also contended that the High Court has\n\n  also failed to take into account the future prospects of the\n\n  deceased, whose business was bound to grow with the\n\n  passage of time. In support of the proposition that rise in\n\n  income of the deceased by way of promotion or otherwise\n\n  should be taken into consideration for determining his\n\n  income earning capacity, reliance was placed on the\n\n  decision of this Court in National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                            5</span>\n\f    Indira Srivastava &amp; Ors.1       It was also pleaded that\n\n    deduction towards personal and living expenses of the\n\n    deceased should have been restricted to only one-third of\n\n    his monthly income.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">8. Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the contesting\n\n    respondents submitted that in view of the fact that no oral\n\n    evidence was adduced by the claimants/appellants to prove\n\n    the income earning capacity of the deceased, reliance on the\n\n    Return of Income, filed by the deceased himself, for\n\n    determining his monthly income, could not be faulted and\n\n    the compensation determined by the High Court cannot be\n\n    said to be arbitrary and, therefore, no intervention in\n\n    exercise of power under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 136</a> of the Constitution is\n\n    called for.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">9. <a href=\"/doc/41160316/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 168</a> of the Act enjoins the Tribunal to make an\n\n    award determining \"the amount of compensation which\n\n    appears to be just.\" However, the objective factors, which\n\n    may constitute the basis of compensation appearing as just,\n\n    have not been indicated in the Act. Thus, the expression\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">1</span>\n       (2008) 2 SCC 763\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                             6</span>\n\f    \"which appears to the just\" vests a wide discretion in the\n\n    Tribunal in the matter of determination of compensation.\n\n    Nevertheless, the wide amplitude of such power does not\n\n    empower the Tribunal to determine the compensation\n\n    arbitrarily, or to ignore settled principles relating to\n\n    determination of compensation. Similarly, although the Act\n\n    is a beneficial legislation, it can neither be allowed to be\n\n    used as a source of profit, nor as a windfall to the persons\n\n    affected nor should it be punitive to the person(s) liable to\n\n    pay compensation.     The determination of compensation\n\n    must be based on certain data, establishing reasonable\n\n    nexus between the loss incurred by the dependents of the\n\n    deceased and the compensation to be awarded to them. In\n\n    nutshell, the amount of compensation determined to be\n\n    payable to the claimant(s) has to be fair and reasonable by\n\n    accepted legal standards.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_17\">\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">10.In General Manager, Kerala State Road Transport\n\n    Corporation, Trivandrum Vs.

The amount awarded must\n\n  not be niggardly since the \"law values life and limb in a free\n\n  society in generous scales\". At the same time, a misplaced\n\n  sympathy, generosity and benevolence cannot be the\n\n  guiding factor for determining the compensation.                 The\n\n  object of providing compensation is to place the claimant(s),\n\n  to the extent possible, in almost the same financial position,\n\n  as they were in before the accident and not to make a\n\n  fortune out of misfortune that has befallen them.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">11.As   noted   earlier,   in   the   matter   of    computation    of\n\n  compensation, there is no uniform rule or formula for\n\n  measuring the value of a human life.              Though a special\n\n  provision for assessment of compensation on structured\n\n  formula basis for the purpose of a claim petition under\n\n  <a href=\"/doc/22871263/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 163A</a> of the Act has been inserted in the Act with\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                    8</span>\n\f    effect from 14th November, 1994, but no such formula has\n\n    been laid down for determination of compensation in a\n\n    claim petition under <a href=\"/doc/136948773/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 166</a> of the Act, though there is\n\n    no bar in taking the said schedule as a guiding factor while\n\n    determining the just compensation by applying multiplier\n\n    method. In fact, in Managing Director, TNSTC Ltd. Vs.\n\n    K.I. Bindu &amp; Ors.3, it has been observed that the second\n\n    schedule to the Act may serve as a guide but cannot be\n\n    used as an invariable ready reckoner.       In a catena of\n\n    decisions of this Court, certain broad principles which could\n\n    be applied for assessing just compensation have been\n\n    highlighted. It has been observed that in a fatal accident\n\n    action, the accepted measure of damages awarded to the\n\n    dependents is the pecuniary loss suffered and likely to be\n\n    suffered by them as a result of abrupt termination of life.\n\n    The question as to what factors should be kept in view for\n\n    calculating pecuniary loss to a dependent came up for\n\n    consideration before a three-Judge Bench of this Court in\n\n    Gobald Motor Service Ltd. &amp; Anr.

Veluswami\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">3</span>\n       (2005) 8 SCC 473\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                                              9</span>\n\f    &amp; Ors.4, with reference to a case under the <a href=\"/doc/594667/\" id=\"a_7\">Fatal Accidents\n\n    Act</a>, 1855, wherein, K. Subba Rao, J. (as His Lordship then\n\n    was) speaking for the Bench observed thus:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">            \"In calculating the pecuniary loss to the\n            dependants many imponderables enter into\n            the calculation. Therefore, the actual extent of\n            the pecuniary loss to the dependants may\n            depend upon data which cannot be\n            ascertained accurately, but must necessarily\n            be an estimate, or even partly a conjecture.\n            Shortly, stated, the general principle is that\n            the pecuniary loss can be ascertained only by\n            balancing on the one hand the loss to the\n            claimants of the future pecuniary benefit and\n            on the other any pecuniary advantage which\n            from whatever source comes to them by\n            reason of the death, that is, the balance of loss\n            and gain to a dependant by the death must be\n            ascertained.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_20\">12.Taking note of the afore-extracted observations in Gobald\n\n    Motor Service Ltd. (supra) in Susamma Thomas (supra), it\n\n    was   observed       that   the   assessment    of   damages   to\n\n    compensate         the dependents    is beset   with difficulties\n\n    because from the nature of things, it has to take into\n\n    account many imponderables, e.g. the life expectancy of the\n\n    deceased and the dependants, the amount that the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">4</span>\n       AIR 1962 SC 1\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                                   1</span>\n\f  deceased would have earned during the remainder of his\n\n  life, the amount that he would have contributed to the\n\n  dependants during that period, the chances that the\n\n  deceased may not have lived or the dependants may not live\n\n  upto the estimated remaining period of their life expectancy,\n\n  the chances that the deceased might have got better\n\n  employment or income or may have lost his employment or\n\n  income altogether.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_21\">\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">13.Thus, for arriving at just compensation, it is necessary to\n\n  ascertain the net income of the deceased available for the\n\n  support of himself and his dependents at the time of his\n\n  death and the amount, which he was accustomed to spend\n\n  upon himself. This exercise has to be on the basis of the\n\n  data, brought on record by the claimant, which again\n\n  cannot be accurately ascertained and necessarily involves\n\n  an element of estimate or it may partly be even a\n\n  conjecture. The figure arrived at by deducting from the net\n\n  income of the deceased such part of income as he was\n\n  spending upon himself, provides a datum, to convert it into\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                                            1</span>\n\f  a lump sum, by capitalising it by an appropriate multiplier\n\n  (when multiplier method is adopted).        An appropriate\n\n  multiplier is again determined by taking into consideration\n\n  several imponderable factors.    Since in the present case\n\n  there is no dispute in regard to the multiplier, we deem it\n\n  unnecessary to dilate on the issue.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_23\">\n</p><p id=\"p_24\">14.In the instant case, the main grievance of the appellant is\n\n  that the High Court erred in reducing the monthly income\n\n  of the deceased from Rs.7,000/- to Rs.4,000/-.     More so,\n\n  when the claim of the appellants was that the deceased was\n\n  earning about Rs.20,000/- per month.         It needs little\n\n  emphasis that insofar as the question of earnings of the\n\n  deceased is concerned, the onus lies on the claimants to\n\n  prove this fact by leading reliable and cogent evidence\n\n  before the Tribunal. A bare assertion in the claim petition\n\n  in that behalf is not sufficient to discharge that onus. In\n\n  the present case, as noticed earlier, the deceased was\n\n  carrying on a business. The Return of Income filed by him\n\n  for the assessment year 1998-1999 (Ex.P-34) was brought\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                                           1</span>\n\fon record along with his monthly turnover and tax paid\n\nstatements submitted to the Commercial Tax Officer (Ex.P-\n\n</p><p id=\"p_25\">27). Copies of the current account (Ex.P-38) showing the\n\nmoney deposited in the bank maintained by the deceased\n\nhave also been brought on record. The Return of Income\n\nfiled on 15th April, 1998 and the accompanying document,\n\nnamely, trading and profit and loss account for the period\n\nending 31st March, 1998 show a net profit of Rs.42,996/-.\n\nTaking into consideration the said documents, the Tribunal\n\ntook the monthly income of the deceased at Rs.7,000/- per\n\nmonth. However, the High Court felt that in the light of the\n\nIncome Tax Return, declaring income from the business\n\ncarried on by the deceased, the yearly income of the\n\ndeceased was not more than Rs.40,000/- and, therefore,\n\nthe Tribunal was not justified in adopting the monthly\n\nincome of the deceased at Rs.7,000/- per month to work\n\nout the loss of dependency. According to the High Court,\n\nthe monthly income of the deceased should have been\n\ntaken at Rs.4,000/- per month.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_26\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                                         1</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_27\">\f15.In our view, though the entries in the current account\n\n  (Ex.P-38) of the deceased and his transactions with his\n\n  client, namely, Vasu Agarbathi (Ex.P-23) may not per se be\n\n  cogent evidence to determine the yearly or monthly income\n\n  of the deceased from the business(s) he was carrying on, yet\n\n  we feel that these are some indicators in support of the\n\n  appellants' plea that the business income of the deceased in\n\n  the succeeding years could be more than what was declared\n\n  for the year ended 31st March, 1998. But it is again in the\n\n  realm of speculation, particularly when, unlike income from\n\n  salaries, earnings in a business may increase with the\n\n  buoyancy in business and at the same time may diminish\n\n  with a recession in trade.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_28\">\n</p><p id=\"p_29\">16.As regards the future prospects of the deceased, as noted\n\n  above, except for copies of account of the deceased in the\n\n  books of account of his client, after the death, no other\n\n  reliable evidence has been brought on record to show the\n\n  future plans of the deceased regarding expansion or\n\n  diversification of his business.    In our view, a bare\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                                           1</span>\n\f  argument by learned counsel for the appellants that the\n\n  deceased had a potential of expanding his business, cannot\n\n  be accepted as sufficient material to determine the future\n\n  prospects of the deceased.     The decisions of this Court\n\n  relied upon by learned counsel for the appellants do not lay\n\n  down any abstract proposition of law in this regard, which\n\n  are otherwise distinguishable on facts.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_30\">\n</p><p id=\"p_31\">17.In the circumstances, having regard to the material on\n\n  record, in our opinion, ends of justice would be met if the\n\n  income of the deceased is taken at Rs.5,500/- per month or\n\n  Rs.66,000/- per annum.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_32\">\n</p><p id=\"p_33\">18.On the question of deduction on account of personal\n\n  expenses by the deceased, there is no set formula which\n\n  could be applied in every case to determine as to what\n\n  should be the deduction on this account.    The contention\n\n  that deduction on that count cannot exceed one-third on\n\n  the ground that there is some statutory recognition in the\n\n  Second Schedule to the Act for such deduction, is\n\n  untenable.   The said deduction would depend upon the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                           1</span>\n\f  facts and circumstances of each case. In the present case,\n\n  no evidence was led on this point as well. In the absence of\n\n  any evidence to the contrary, the practice is to deduct\n\n  towards personal and living expenses of the deceased, one-\n\n  third of the income in case he was married and one-half\n\n  (50%) if he was a bachelor. Thus, there is no material on\n\n  record warranting interference with the consistent view of\n\n  both the courts below on the point.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_34\">\n</p><p id=\"p_35\">19.In view of the above discussion, the loss of dependency is\n\n  determined as Rs.33,000/- per annum and by applying a\n\n  multiplier of 14, the total loss of dependency is arrived at\n\n  Rs.4,62,000/-.   Adding Rs.20,000/- awarded under other\n\n  heads, the quantum of compensation is determined at\n\n  Rs.4,82,000/-. The amount shall also carry an interest at\n\n  the rate of 6% per annum, as awarded by the Tribunal, from\n\n  the date of the filing of the claim petition till the date of\n\n  actual payment. If any amount has already been paid or\n\n  deposited in terms of order passed by the Tribunal, the\n\n  same shall be adjusted from the amount now being\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                                            1</span>\n\f  awarded.   The interest element shall also be worked out\n\n  after the said adjustment.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_36\">\n</p><p id=\"p_37\">20.In the result, the appeal succeeds in part and the judgment\n\n  of the High Court stands modified to the extent indicated\n\n  above. No order as to costs.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_38\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_39\">                                 ...........................................J.\n                                 ( R.V.

Mr.     Gupta\n\nsubmitted     that    the     appellants     were       similarly\n\nsituated and it was their common ground that they\n\nwere   receiving     lesser   salary     than     their      junior.\n\nMr. Gupta submitted that Paragraph 7 of the writ\n\npetition     was   absolutely    clear     that    it     was   the\n\ncommon case of the appellants that since they were\n\nreceiving lesser pay than their junior, Shri Ram\n\nPrakash Shori, who was receiving a higher salary,\n\ntheir salaries were also required to be stepped up\n\nto that of Shri Shori.          Mr. Gupta also urged that\n\nthe position would be further clarified from the\n\nquestion of law formulated in Paragraph 9 of the\n\nwrit   petition.        It    was   urged       that      it    was,\n\ntherefore, wrong to say that no case had been made\n\nout on behalf of the appellant No.1 and hence no\n\nrelief could be granted in his favour.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                                                        6</span>\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">9.   Referring to prayer (iv) in the writ petition,\n\n     Mr.    Gupta    urged      that    specific      reference         had\n\n     been     made     to    the      appellant      No.2,      Satinder\n\n     Singh, since his pay had been stepped up but\n\n     was, thereafter, reduced by an order dated 9th\n\n     July,     2002,      passed       by     the   respondent         No.3\n\n     withdrawing the benefit of pay fixation which\n\n     had already been given to him.                  Mr. Gupta urged\n\n     that the prayer, however, was not confined to\n\n     the appellant No.2 alone, but to the appellant\n\n     No.1 also, as otherwise the very purpose of him\n\n     being made petitioner No.1 in the writ petition\n\n     would be meaningless.              Mr. Gupta submitted that\n\n     the High Court was             misled into relying on the\n\n     statement made in paragraph 7 of the written\n\n     statement filed by the respondent in dismissing\n\n     the writ petition as far as the appellant No.1\n\n     was     concerned.         Even    while       considering        the\n\n     review    petition,         in    the     absence     of    learned\n\n     counsel     for      the      appellants,       the     Court      was\n\n     persuaded       to     accept      the     statement       made     on\n\n     behalf of the respondent that relief claimed in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                                                    7</span>\n\n\n      the review petition had not been claimed in the\n\n      writ petition itself as far as the appellant\n\n      No.1 is concerned and the review petition was\n\n      not,    therefore,      maintainable.                Mr.    Gupta\n\n      submitted that the orders passed on the writ\n\n      petition and review petitions were passed on an\n\n      erroneous understanding that the appellant No.1\n\n      had    not   prayed   for   any    relief       in    the    writ\n\n      petition and he was not therefore entitled to\n\n      the reliefs prayed for by the appellants.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">10.     Mr. Jagdish Singh Chhabra, who appeared for\n\n      the    Punjab   State   Electricity        Board       and    its\n\n      authorities,     reiterated       the    submissions         made\n\n      before the High Court that in the absence of\n\n      any case being made out or any relief being\n\n      claimed on behalf of the appellant No.1 in the\n\n      writ    petition      the   High        Court        had    quite\n\n      correctly dismissed the writ petition on the\n\n      ground that no relief could be given to the\n\n      appellant No.1 and the relief prayed for by the\n\n      appellant No.2 had already been given to him.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                                                     8</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">11.   Mr.   Chhabra     also     attempted       to    justify       the\n\n      disparity in the pay of Shri Shori and the\n\n      appellant No.1 by urging that the appellant No.\n\n      1 had been granted the promotional scale with\n\n      effect     from    1st    January,       1996,     where       the\n\n      benefits of increment in the scale were lower.\n\n      On the other hand, Shri Shori who joined the\n\n      services of the Board in 1974, was granted the\n\n      promotional       scale    on     17th    May,     2006,      with\n\n      effect    from     1st    September,       2001,       when    the\n\n      increments and the pay-scales were higher.                     Mr.\n\n      Chhabra submitted that it is the disparity in\n\n      the   incremental         benefits       that    led    to     the\n\n      anomaly of the appellant No.1 getting a lower\n\n      salary in the promotional scale.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_22\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">12. Having regard to the submissions made on behalf\n\nof    the      respective       parties,        we     have      little\n\nhesitation      in   accepting        Mr.   Gupta's      submissions\n\nthat since the writ petition had been jointly filed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                                                       9</span>\n\n\non behalf of the appellants, whose interest was\n\ncommon, the prayer therein should not have been\n\nconfined to the appellant No.2 alone and that the\n\nHigh     Court    should        have    granted        relief    to    the\n\nappellant No.1 also by directing that his pay also\n\nbe stepped up to that of his junior, Shri R.P.\n\nShori.       Although, this question does not appear to\n\nhave    been     gone    into      by   the    High    Court     for   the\n\nsimple reason that the writ petition was disposed\n\nof only on the averments contained in paragraph 7\n\nof     the    written     statement           filed    on     behalf    of\n\nrespondents       that    the      grievance      of    the     appellant\n\nNo.2 duly addressed, there ought to have been at\n\nleast some discussion in the judgment of the High\n\nCourt regarding the claim of the appellant No.1.\n\nUnfortunately, the case of the appellant No.1 was\n\nnot considered at all by the High Court.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_24\">13.    Something        may   be    said      with     regard     to   Mr.\n\nChhabra's        submissions        about       the    difference       in\n\nincrement in the scales which the appellant No.1\n\nand Shri Shori are placed, but the same is still\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                                              10</span>\n\n\ncontrary to the settled principle of law that a\n\nsenior    cannot    be   paid    lesser     salary    than    his\n\njunior. In such circumstances, even if, there was a\n\ndifference in the incremental benefits in the scale\n\ngiven to the appellant No.1 and the scale given to\n\nShri    Shori,   such    anomaly     should    not   have    been\n\nallowed    to    continue      and   ought     to    have    been\n\nrectified so that the pay of the appellant No.1 was\n\nalso stepped up to that of Shri Shori, as appears\n\nto have been done in the case of the appellant\n\nNo.2.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_25\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_26\">14. We are unable to accept the reasoning of the\n\n   High Court in this regard or the submissions\n\n   made in support thereof by Mr. Chhabra, since\n\n   the very object to be achieved is to bring the\n\n   pay scale of the appellant No.1 at par with that\n\n   of his junior.         We are clearly of the opinion\n\n   that    the     reasoning    of    the     High   Court    was\n\n   erroneous       and   the    appellant     No.1    was    also\n\n   entitled to the same benefits of pay parity with\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                                         11</span>\n\n\n   Shri Shori as has been granted to the appellant\n\n   No.2.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_27\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_28\">15.We, accordingly, allow the appeals and set aside\n\n   the judgment of the High Court.

The incident leading to the prosecution of the appellants\n\noccurred on 29.05.2002.      Dinesh, son of Dharambir (PW-1)\n\ncomplainant, had gone to Delhi for ascertaining the date of his\n\ninterview   for    recruitment   to   the   Police   Force   of    Delhi\n\nGovernment, but till late night he did not return to his village\n\nSundana, Tehsil Kalanaur, District Rohtak.           On the following\n\nday, i.e. 30.05.2002, at about 4.00 a.m. Randhir Singh (PW-10)\n\nelder brother of PW-11 told PW-1 that Dinesh was wrongfully\n\nconfined in the house of appellant-Suraj Bhan (A-1).              It was\n\nJagbir (PW-9), a jeep driver, who disclosed this fact to PW-10.\n\nOn coming to know the fact of confinement of his son by A-1,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                                               4</span>\n\n\nPW-1 alongwith his father Sube Singh (PW-11) and uncle\n\nRaghbir Singh rushed to the house of A-1, where they found the\n\nouter door of the house bolted from inside. They all heard the\n\nshrieks of Dinesh \"maar diya, maar diya\".       Thereupon, they\n\npeeped through the window and saw that all the appellants\n\nincluding A-6 (since acquitted) had made Dinesh to lie down on\n\nthe floor of the room, his hands and legs were tied with a rope.\n\nIn the electric bulb light and within their sight, A-1 inserted a\n\n\"danda\" (wooden stick) in the anus of Dinesh, who cried loudly\n\nin pain. On seeing the occurrence, PW-1, PW-11 and Raghbir\n\nSingh raised an alarm and forcibly broke open the door of the\n\nroom. On seeing them, the appellants fled away and took\n\n\"danda\" and piece of rope with them. They attended Dinesh, but\n\nhe succumbed to his injuries at the spot.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">6.   Motive behind the alleged occurrence was that about a\n\nyear prior to the incident in question, i.e. 28.04.2001, A-1 got a\n\ncase registered against Dinesh under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 376</a> IPC for\n\ncommitting sexual intercourse with his daughter.      In the said\n\ncase, Dinesh was acquitted by the trial court on 18.03.2002.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                                             5</span>\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">7.   PW-1 requested his father Sube Singh (PW-11) and uncle\n\nRaghbir Singh to safe guard the dead body of Dinesh at the\n\nplace of occurrence and himself rushed to the Police Station for\n\nlodging a report.   On the way, Om Parkash, ASI (PW-14) met\n\nPW-1 at the curve of Beri Road, where, he made statement\n\n(Ex.PA) at 9.00 a.m. narrating the entire incident. PW-14 then\n\nmade his endorsement (Ex.PA-2) on the said report and sent the\n\nsame to the Police Station through Constable Krishan Kumar,\n\non the basis of which formal FIR (Ex. PJ) was recorded by MHC\n\nMohinder Singh (PW-6) at 11.00 a.m. on the same day.         The\n\nSpecial Report thereof was sent to the Illaqa Judicial Magistrate\n\nthrough Constable Udham Singh (PW-4), which was received at\n\nhis residence at 2.35 p.m. at Rohtak.        Thereafter, PW-14\n\nalongwith PW-1 rushed to the place of occurrence and got the\n\ndead body photographed from Gobind Ram, Photographer\n\n(PW-7).   PW-14 prepared the inquest report (Ex.

At the spot, rough site plan (Ex.PR) of the\n\nplace of occurrence was also prepared by the Investigating\n\nOfficer.

After\n\ntaking his opinion Ex.PO, pieces of \"danda\" were resealed. After\n\ncompletion of the investigation and receipt of the post mortem\n\nreport and other material on record, charge sheet came to be\n\nfiled against the accused.        At the initial stage, A-1, A-2, A-3 and\n\nA-4 were challaned for commission of offences punishable under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1243353/\" id=\"a_8\">Sections    342</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_9\">302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_10\">34</a>     IPC.

The accused in their statements recorded under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_12\">Section\n\n313</a> Cr.P.C denied the incriminating evidence appearing against\n\nthem. They pleaded that they have been implicated in a false\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                                                 9</span>\n\n\ncase and they claimed to be innocent. They examined three\n\ndefence witnesses, namely, Suraj Mal (DW-1), who deposed\n\nregarding disconnection of the electric connection at the house\n\nof A-1; Rajinder Singh, DSP (DW-2), on whose verification three\n\npersons, namely, Sajjan, Dharambir and Sube Singh were found\n\ninnocent in this case and Jagbir (DW-3) who was married to\n\nPoonam, daughter of Suraj Bhan (A-1) on 26.05.2002. DW-3\n\nstated    that   on   the   evening   of   25.09.2002   Dinesh   had\n\nmisbehaved with his wife at his Village Kohla.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">12.    The trial court, on appraisal of the entire evidence on\n\nrecord, held A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4, A-5 and A-7 guilty of the charges\n\nand convicted them under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1243353/\" id=\"a_14\">342</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_15\">Section\n\n34</a> of Indian Penal Code. However, learned trial judge acquitted\n\nA-6.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">13.      Being aggrieved, the accused filed three sets of separate\n\nappeals before the High Court. The High Court dismissed the\n\nappeals of A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-4.          It, however, allowed the\n\nappeals of A-5 and A-7 and accordingly acquitted them.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                                                  10</span>\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">14.   Feeling   aggrieved   thereby   and   dissatisfied   with   the\n\njudgment of the High Court, the above-said appeals have been\n\nfiled in this Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_17\">15. Ms. Garima Prashad, learned counsel appearing on behalf of\n\nthe appellants, contended that the evidence produced in this\n\ncase is not sufficient and convincing to warrant the conviction of\n\nthe appellants. She contended that the evidence of PW-1 and\n\nPW-11 could not be accepted as they are both interested\n\nwitnesses related to the deceased.      She next contended that\n\nPW-1, PW-9 and PW-10 in their deposition have given a\n\nconcocted version which casts severe doubts about truthfulness\n\nof the prosecution case.    The learned counsel also contended\n\nthat the evidence appearing on record against the appellants is\n\nverbatim version which was taken into consideration by the trial\n\ncourt with regard to the acquittal of A-5, A-6 and A-7 and,\n\ntherefore, the case of the appellants cannot be decided on any\n\nother scale and should have been treated at par for giving\n\nbenefits of doubt to the appellants as it was considered for the\n\nacquittal of A-5, A-6 and A-7. The learned counsel then\n\ncontended that as per the post mortem report (Ex. PK), as many\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                                                   11</span>\n\n\nas 12 injuries were found on the dead body of Dinesh which\n\nwould support the defence version of DW-3 that the deceased\n\nwas given beatings by the village people of his village Kohla,\n\nwhen Dinesh misbehaved with his wife at their residence on\n\n29.05.2002. It was also argued that there is no reliable evidence\n\nbrought on record to prove that the appellants also shared\n\ncommon intention to murder Dinesh and in the absence of such\n\nevidence, the appellants could not be convicted for offence\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 302</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 34</a> IPC.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">16.   Mr. Sandeep Chaturvedi, Advocate, appearing on behalf of\n\nthe appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 615/2008, has adopted\n\nand supported the arguments made by Ms. Garima Prashad,\n\nAdvocate.     As against that, Mr. Rajiv Gaur Naseem, Advocate\n\nappearing on behalf of the State, has canvassed for the\n\ncorrectness of the view taken by the trial judge which was\n\nconfirmed by the High Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_19\">17.   In order to appreciate the aforesaid rival contentions of the\n\nlearned     counsel   for   the   parties,   we   have   independently\n\nscrutinized the oral and documentary evidence appearing on\n\nrecord.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                                            12</span><p id=\"p_20\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">18. PW-1, father of the deceased Dinesh, at the relevant time\n\n   was serving in the Police Department. On 29.05.2002 he was\n\n   on leave for a period of one month. He stated that his son\n\n   Dinesh had applied for recruitment in the Police of Delhi\n\n   Government. On 29.05.2002 Dinesh had gone to Delhi to\n\n   confirm about the date of interview to be held for the post.\n\n   He did not return to his house till late in the night.    On\n\n   30.05.2002 at about 4.00 a.m., Randhir Singh, elder brother\n\n   of his father Sube Singh (PW-11), came to his house and\n\n   disclosed that Dinesh was wrongfully confined by A-1 in his\n\n   house. This information was given to Randhir Singh by\n\n   Jagbir (PW-9), a jeep driver. On receipt of this information,\n\n   he alongwith his father (PW-11) and uncle Randhir Singh\n\n   went to the house of A-1. The outer door of the house of A-1\n\n   was found bolted from inside. They peeped through the\n\n   window and noticed that Dinesh was made to lie facing his\n\n   face towards the floor of the room. At that time, an electric\n\n   bulb was burning inside the room. A-1 inserted \"danda\" in\n\n   the anus of Dinesh in their presence and his hands and both\n\n   legs were tied by a piece of rope. Dinesh was crying in pain.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                                             13</span>\n\n\nThey raised cry and in the process they broke open the door\n\nand entered the room.      All the accused ran away carrying\n\n\"danda\" and \"rope\" with them. As per his version, in spite of\n\ntheir best efforts, Dinesh could not be survived. He also\n\nstated that about one year prior to the present incident, A-1\n\ngot a false case registered against Dinesh under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 376</a>\n\nIPC in which his son was acquitted by the Court and as a\n\nresult thereof, A-1 was nursing a grudge against his son. He\n\ntestified the contents of the repot (Ex.PA) lodged to the Police,\n\non the basis of which FIR (Ex. PJ) came to be registered by\n\nPW-6 at the Police Station. This witness has corroborated the\n\nversion of PW-12, the Investigating Officer, in regard to\n\ntaking into possession blood stained earth, a pair of sports\n\nshoes belonging to deceased Dinesh and preparation of the\n\nparcels containing the seized articles affixed with seals. He\n\nshowed his knowledge of ignorance about the marriage of the\n\ndaughter of A-1 with Jagbir (DW-3) son of Om Prakash,\n\nresident of village Kohlapur, District Sonipat. A suggestion\n\nthat on 29.05.2002 Dinesh had gone to village Kohlapur and\n\nthere he misbehaved with Poonam, as a result thereof he was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                                               14</span>\n\n\n  given beatings by the village people, has been emphatically\n\n  denied by him. He has identified two pieces of \"danda\"\n\n  (Exs.P-18 and P-19), which were used by A-1 in the\n\n  commission of the crime. He categorically stated that there\n\n  was sufficient electric bulb light inside the room when they\n\n  saw accused persons giving beatings to Dinesh. A suggestion\n\n  of the defence that on receiving telephonic information from\n\n  Jagbir (DW-3) son-in-law of A-1, he alongwith his father PW-\n\n  11 and A-1 went to village Kohla in a hired jeep and brought\n\n  his injured son in the said jeep and then they threshed\n\n  Dinesh at bus stand of village Sundana and as a result\n\n  whereof Dinesh died on 30.05.2002 at about 8.00 p.m., has\n\n  been denied by him.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_22\">19.PW-11,   the   second   eyewitness   of   the   incident,   has\n\n  corroborated the entire testimony of PW-1.       He was cross-\n\n  examined at length but nothing could be elicited from his\n\n  statement which casts any doubt about the truthfulness of\n\n  his testimony. Jagbir PW-9, the jeep driver, deposed that on\n\n  29.05.2002 at about 8.30 a.m. Ballu (A-2) alongwith four\n\n  other persons, who were identified in the Court, came to his\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">\f                                                          15</span>\n\n\nhouse and asked him to take them to village Kohla. They\n\nhired his jeep and he took them to village Kohla. They left\n\nhim with his jeep on the village street. On hearing alarm, he\n\nrushed to the place where he found son of PW-1 present. All\n\nthe five accused persons then asked him to take the son of\n\nPW-1 to village Sundana, but initially he refused to oblige\n\nthem as he apprehended danger to the life of the son of PW-\n\n1, but later on from the village Kohla he took the son of PW-1\n\nalongwith A-1 and six more persons in the jeep and left them\n\nexcept Sube Singh (A-6) at bus stand of village Sudana. He\n\ndisclosed this incident to Randhir Singh Subedar uncle of\n\nPW-1 on the same night.         This witness in the cross-\n\nexamination has stated that village Kohla is at a distance of\n\n15-16 KMs from Gohana and Gohana is at a distance of\n\nabout 25-30 KMs from Rohtak, whereas village Kohla is at a\n\ndistance of about 60 KMs from village Sundana. He stated\n\nthat A-1 and son (Deceased) of PW-1 had met him at the\n\nhouse of the daughter of A-1 in village Kohla. He admitted\n\nthat A-1 told him that prior to this incident Dinesh had\n\nteased his daughter and on the day of incident Dinesh had\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">\f                                                             16</span>\n\n\n   gone to the house of DW-3, son-in-law of A-1. A suggestion of\n\n   the defence that Dinesh was assaulted by the people of\n\n   village Kohla and as a result thereof, he could not walk\n\n   properly has been denied by him. He also denied the\n\n   suggestion that he had brought injured Dinesh in his jeep\n\n   and left him at Sundana Bus Stand. A further suggestion\n\n   that   PW-1    and   PW-11   grandfather   of   Dinesh,   had\n\n   accompanied him in the jeep while going to village Sundana,\n\n   has been denied by him.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_23\">20.Randhir Singh (PW-10) deposed that on 30.05.2002 at about\n\n   2.30 a.m. while he was sleeping in his house, Jagbir (PW-9)\n\n   came there and disclosed that A-1 had confined Dinesh in\n\n   his house.    He immediately rushed to the house of PW-1,\n\n   woke him up and thereafter passed on the said information\n\n   to PW-1.     He stated that on the next morning, he came to\n\n   know about the murder of Dinesh in the house of A-1.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_24\">21. In the teeth of the evidence of eyewitnesses PWs 1 and 11,\n\n   corroborated by the testimony of PW-9 and PW-10 discussed\n\n   above, it is established beyond any shadow of doubt that in\n\n   fact the occurrence had taken place at the given time in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">\f                                                           17</span>\n\n\nhouse of A-1 where the dead body of Dinesh was found lying\n\nby the Police which was sent to the Doctor for post mortem\n\nexamination. PW-1 immediately lodged complaint (Ex. PJ) of\n\nthe incident to                   Om Prakash, ASI (PW-14) who\n\nmet him on the way leading to the Police Station. The names\n\nof all the accused were specifically mentioned in the said\n\ncomplaint. The accused persons were not found present in\n\nthe village when the Investigating Officer visited the place of\n\noccurrence. A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-4 were produced before\n\nRohtas Singh S.I. (PW-12) by Zile Singh, who is the resident\n\nof the same village. Recovery of two pieces of \"danda\" (Exs.P-\n\n18 and P-19) and \"rope\" (Ex. PQ/3) taken into possession by\n\nPW-12 pursuant to the disclosure statement (Ex.PQ) made by\n\nA-1 during the course of interrogation, has been proved\n\nwhich were used by the appellants in the commission of the\n\noffence.   The ocular version of PW-1 and PW-11, the\n\neyewitnesses, has been further corroborated by Dr. Paramjit,\n\nwho found as many as 12 injuries on the dead body of\n\nDinesh.

In the opinion of Dr. Paramjit, the cause of death of Dinesh\n\nwas shock and haemorrhage due to multiple injuries to the vital\n\norgans which were ante-mortem in nature and sufficient to\n\ncause death in ordinary course of nature.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_44\">23.          On reappraisal and scrutiny of the evidence discussed\n\n      hereinabove, we find no particular reason as to why the two\n\n      eyewitnesses PW-1 and PW-11 should falsely depose against\n\n      the appellants. It is difficult to believe that the relatives of\n\n      deceased Dinesh would spare his real assailants and falsely\n\n      involve other persons responsible for committing the offence.\n\n      It is well settled that if the witness is related to the deceased,\n\n      his evidence has to be accepted if found to be reliable and\n\n      believable because he would inter alia be interested in\n\n      ensuring that real culprits are punished. The trial court as\n\n      well as the High Court have rightly held that there was a\n\n      motive for the accused to commit murder of Dinesh because\n\n      as per the prosecution evidence,     A-1 was nursing a grudge\n\n      against the deceased because he allegedly sexually assaulted\n\n      his daughter, for which offence Dinesh was acquitted by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">\f                                                                  22</span>\n\n\n      trial court on 18.03.2002 whereas the prosecutrix was later\n\n      on married to DW-3 on 26.05.2002. Dinesh was murdered on\n\n      the intervening night of 29/30.05.2002 in the house of A-1 in\n\n      village Sundana.   The evidence of PWs 1 and 11 has been\n\n      found to be satisfactory, reliable, consistent and creditable\n\n      by the trial court as well as by the High Court.       Both the\n\n      witnesses have been cross-examined at length by the\n\n      defence, but nothing tangible has been extracted from their\n\n      evidence to create any shadow of doubt that they are not\n\n      truthful witnesses. They have given reliable and consistent\n\n      version of the crime and their evidence inspires confidence.\n\n      On our examination of the judgment given by the trial court\n\n      and confirmed by the High Court, we find that both the\n\n      Courts have properly and rightly appreciated and re-\n\n      appreciated the entire evidence on record and there is no\n\n      infirmity or perversity in the findings recorded by the Courts\n\n      below to interfere with the well-reasoned judgments.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_45\">24.

In that case, the evidence of two\n\neyewitnesses who were brother of the deceased with regard\n\nto participation of four other accused was found unreliable\n\nand in the peculiar facts and circumstances of that case, the\n\nconviction of those accused was held illegal by the Supreme\n\nCourt. In the present case, no reliable and clinching evidence\n\nwas found by the trial court and by the High Court against A-\n\n5, A-6 and A-7 who also participated in the commission of\n\nthe offence, therefore, they were rightly acquitted by the\n\nCourts. Therefore, the contention that the appellants shall\n\nbe held entitled to the benefit of doubt in the same manner\n\nas A-5, A-6 and A-7 have been acquitted cannot be accepted.\n\nThe occurrence as spoken by the eyewitnesses is fully\n\nestablished,   therefore,   all   the   appellants    will    be\n\nconstructively liable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 302</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 34</a>\n\nIPC for the commission of the crime, though the fatal injury\n\nwas inflicted by A-1, only as the other appellants participated\n\nin giving beatings to the deceased which caused injuries on\n\nother part of his body.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">\f                                                                         24</span><p id=\"p_46\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_47\">25.No other point has been raised by the appellants.

Indisputably an advertisement was issued on 9th August, 1998 for\n\nfilling up 10 posts of Physical Education Teacher Grade-III. 10 Bonus\n\nmarks were to be granted for candidates who were resident of a particular\n\ndistrict, while 5 bonus marks to the candidates belonging to rural areas.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">4.    Validity and/or legality of the said provision for grant of bonus marks\n\nwas questioned before the said High Court by filing writ petition in the year\n\n1999. The question was referred to a Full Bench. A Full Bench of the said\n\nCourt by a judgment and order dated 18th November, 1999 held the said\n\nprovision to be unconstitutional.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">5.    Upon declaration of the said law by the Full Bench of the High Court,\n\nappellants herein filed two writ petitions being No. 1818/2001 and\n\n1802/2001 before the said High Court inter alia contending that in view of\n\nthe said Full Bench decision, their position would be at serial Nos. 6 and 9\n\nin the merit list.

Allegedly the State of Rajasthan appointed Bhanwar Lal Gosar\n\n(Mothsar) by an order dated 12th June, 2003. Two writ petitions were filed\n\nby the appellants. However, in the meanwhile one Duli Chand had filed a\n\nwrit application being S.B. Civil Writ Petition No.1401 of 2003 before the\n\nHigh Court. A learned Single Judge of the High Court dismissed the said\n\nwrit petition on 17th February, 2003 opining that the same was barred by\n\ndelay and latches.      Following Duli Chand (supra) the appellants' writ\n\napplications (Civil Writ Petition Nos. 5510/2003; 1818/2001 and\n\n1802/2002) were also dismissed by the same learned Judge by an order\n\ndated 5th December, 2003.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">8.

Before adverting to the rival contentions raised by the parties we may\n\nnotice that according to the appellants even today their exists two vacancies.\n\nThe purported chart prepared by the appellants and the records placed\n\nbefore us show some discrepancy. At this stage, thus, it is not possible for\n\nus to go into the details thereof particularly when the candidates already\n\nappointed are not parties before us.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_36\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_37\">15.          The select list was prepared in the year 1998. In our opinion it would\n\nbe difficult to issue any direction for appointment of the appellants herein at\n\nthis stage.        Select list was prepared keeping in view the rules as they\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                               6</span>\n\fexisted.   The said Rules might have been declared ultra vires but as\n\nindicated hereinbefore this Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_3\">Article\n\n142</a> of the Constitution of India though it fit to give a prospective effect\n\nthereto. It did so inter alia for the purpose of protecting the services of those\n\nteachers who had already been appointed and had been in service for a few\n\nyears. Out of ten posts, eights teachers were appointed on or before 18th\n\nNovember, 1999 which was the cut off date.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_38\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_39\">16.   Indisputably the merit list was modified in terms of the dicta laid\n\ndown by this Court in Kailash Chand Sharma (supra).\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_40\">17.   The question as to whether the fresh appointees who are, having\n\nregard to the said modification, required to be appointed on the premise that\n\nthey are placed higher in the select list than the appellants or not, in our\n\nopinion, cannot be gone into by us for the first time since such a contention\n\nhad never been raised before the High Court. The entire record of the\n\nmatter, furthermore, are not before us.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_41\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_42\">18.   It is stated that two appointments were made in the year 2003 - one\n\nagainst OBC quota and another against General quota. It is not possible for\n\nus to go into the question as to whether the entire quota for appointment in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                            7</span>\n\fthe category of OBC was filled up in the year 1998-1999 itself and thus\n\nappointment made against the vacant post from the said quota is illegal or\n\nnot. The concerned respondents are not parties before us.        We have not\n\nbeen informed as to whether any other person has been left out from the\n\noriginal merit list\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_43\">19.   Furthermore the select list would ordinarily remain valid for one year.\n\nWe fail to understand on what basis appointments were made in 2003 or\n\nsubsequently. Whether the validity of the said select list was extended or\n\nnot is not known. Extension of select list must be done in accordance with\n\nlaw. Apart from a bald statement made in the list of dates that the validity\n\nof the said select list had been extended, no document in support thereof has\n\nbeen placed before us.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_44\">\n</p><p id=\"p_45\">      <a href=\"/doc/1755546/\" id=\"a_4\">In State of Rajasthan &amp; ors. vs. Jagdish Chopra</a> [(2007) 8 SCC 161],\n\nthis Court held:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_46\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">             \"9.

Considering the insignificant nature of the claim we do not propose to\n\n   interfere in these appeals. The liability which has been found against the appellant\n\n   herein is only for the amount of interest of Rs.6984/- and Rs. 15309/- respectively\n\n   at the rate of 12%.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_2\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_3\">   2.        Shri Raju Ramachandran learned senior counsel urges before us that,\n\n   firstly, there could not be any liability found against the appellant as the appellant\n\n   had, in fact, filed an appeal under <a href=\"/doc/36356506/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 35-L</a> of the Central Excise Act.\n\n   According to him there is an incorrect reference in the impugned order that such\n\n   appeal has not been filed. It is true that the fact that the appeal was filed was\n\n   pleaded but, probably, it was not pointed out to the National Commission at the\n\n   time of arguments. Be that as it may, for the reason we have stated, we will not go\n\n   into that issue.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                 :2:</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">\f       3.          Shri Raju Ramachandran also raises another point regarding the\n\n       \"deficiency in service\" and urges that in the present circumstances it cannot be\n\n       said that there was any deficiency in service on the part of the appellant. That\n\n       question unfortunately has not been raised specifically before the National\n\n       Commission and therefore, we would not go into this question at this juncture.\n\n       However, we leave that question open so that there can be a finding on the\n\n       question at the proper stage and by the proper authority.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">        4.

The latter submitted an application to Gram Panchayat Taleigao (for short `the\n\nGram Panchayat') for grant of permission to construct hotel complex near\n\nVainguinim beach.     On a reference made by the Gram Panchayat, Chief Town\n\nPlanner, Government of Goa, Daman and Diu vide his letter dated 1.8.1978 informed\n\nthat the plans submitted by appellant No.1 are in conformity with the regulations in\n\nforce in the area but observed that right of the public to access the beach must be\n\nmaintained by providing necessary footpath.

Instead he, on his own, wrote letter\n\ndated 29.9.1979 to appellant No.1 giving an impression that the Gram Panchayat\n\ndoes not have any objection to the change of location of the footpath and parking\n\narea. Thereafter, appellant No.1 is said to have shifted access to the beach from the\n\nlocation originally sanctioned.    However, the maps produced before this Court\n\nduring the course of hearing show that the footpath is still near the gas tank.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">(vii)      In the meanwhile, Shri Gustavo Renato da Cruz Pinto, Smt. Surana\n\nPepfira Pinto and Miss Befta Sara Da Costa Pinto filed Special Civil Suit\n\nNo.313/1978/A in the Court of Civil Judge, Senior Division, at Panaji against\n\nappellant No.2, Dr. Alvaro Remiojo Binto and four others for a decree of possession\n\nby pre-emption in respect of the land comprised in survey Nos.787 and 805 and also\n\nto restrain the defendants, their agents, servants, etc. from changing, alienating or\n\nraising any construction on the suit land by alleging that they were owners of\n\nproperty bearing survey Nos.803, 804, 806, 807, 788 and 789 situated at Taleigao and\n\nsince time immemorial they and their predecessors were using footpath passing\n\nthrough survey Nos.787, 805 and 769 for going to Panaji-Dona Paola-Bambolim\n\nroad, which was sought to be obstructed. Defendant No.1 in the suit (appellant No.2\n\nherein) filed written statement to contest the suit. After some time, the parties\n\ncompromised the matter in terms of which the plaintiffs gave up their claim for pre-\n\nemption in respect of plot bearing survey Nos.787 and 805 and defendant No.1\n\nagreed to exchange the plot bearing survey No.790 with plots bearing survey Nos.788\n\nand 789 belonging to the plaintiffs and also that it will have no right of access\n\fthrough any of the properties of the plaintiffs. As a sequel to this, the plaintiffs\n\napplied for withdrawal of the suit. By an order dated 20.12.1978, the Civil Judge\n\npermitted them to do so.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">(viii)     Soon after withdrawal of the suit for pre-emption, appellant No.1 made an\napplication dated 15.11.1978 to Shri Shankar Laad, Minister of Revenue,\nGovernment of Goa for acquisition of land comprised in survey Nos.788, 789, 803,\n804, 806 and 807 (new Nos.246/3, 246/4, 246/2, 245/2, etc.) of Village Taleigao, Dona\nPaula for construction of Beach Resort Hotel Complex by highlighting its benefit to\nthe State.

In the first phase of the hotel complex it is necessary to develop plot\nNo.787 and to immediately proceed to construct the Hotel Building thereon. The\nland in plot No.787 consists of hilly and rocky area and the land abutting on the\nbeach is also of different levels. In order to put up a hotel building in this plot it\nwould be necessary to undertake cutting of rock which would disturb the topography\nof the area entailing considerable expense. It is, therefore, necessary that the lay-out\nfor the hotel building is finalized in a manner that the rock cutting is minimized and,\nat the same time, the natural surroundings of the rock and foliage is maintained.\nExclusive cutting of rock is also likely to result in land-slides and may pose danger to\nthe foundation of the hotel buildings and its residents. It is, therefore, necessary to\nconstruct the hotel building as near the beach as possible, i.e. on the lowest level of\nthe land abutting the beach.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">5.         There are two small plots bearing No.788 and 789 area abutting the beach.\nThose two small plots fall almost midway along the beach frontage of our said plot\nNo.787 and project into the said plot. Those two small plots are in the lowest level of\nthe land and as such are most suited for including in the lay-out plan of the hotel.\nThese two small plots being closest to the beach it is essential for us to install a first\naid post and a medical aid centre for providing safety measures to the people using\nthe beach facilities. Besides it is a precondition for a beach resort hotel giving\n\fcomforts to provide those facilities both for the residents and for public at large.\nKeeping in view those factors it is necessary that these two small plots of land are\nimmediately acquired and included in the lay-out plan of the hotel. It is also\nnecessary that the acquisition of these two small plots of land is urgently completed\nand possession handed over to enable the lay out plan of the hotel building to be\nreadjusted at this initial stage itself, on the ground prepared by proper leveling and\nterracing before the actual construction work could begin. It is, therefore, necessary\nthat the two plots of land be urgently acquired in the first instance so that there is no\ndelay whatsoever in implementing the first phase of the hotel project.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">6.           In order to take in hand the second phase of the hotel complex it would be\ndesirable to acquire plot Nos. 803 and 804 which intervene between our second Plot\nNo. 805 and our first plot No. 787 and plot Nos. 806 and 807 which adjoin our second\nplot No. 805. This would enable us to undertake the second phase of the project as\ndescribed above. The entire complex will then become one composite unit and these\nfacilities could then be easily availed of by the hotel residents and the resident of this\nterritory. The facilities provided by the hotel will be open for use on membership to\nnon-residents also. Such facilities are not readily and easily available to the people of\nthis.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_18\">\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">(ix)       Acting on the application made by the developer, the Government of Goa\n\nissued notification No.HD/LQN/315/78 dated 29.10.1980 under <a href=\"/doc/169774/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 4(1)</a> of Land\n\nAcquisition Act, 1894 (for short `the 1894 Act') for acquisition of the plots comprised\n\nin survey No.803 (new No.246/2) and survey No.804 (new No.245/2).\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">(x)        After holding enquiry under <a href=\"/doc/85678/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 5A</a> of the 1894 Act, the State\n\nGovernment issued declaration under <a href=\"/doc/1792838/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 6</a>, which was published in Gazette\n\ndated 27.10.1983.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_21\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">(xi)       Gustavo Renato da Cruz Pinto and some others filed Writ Petition\n\nNo.8/1984 for quashing the aforementioned notifications on various grounds\n\nincluding the one that before acquiring the land, government did not make enquiry\n\nas per the requirement of Rule 4 of the Land Acquisition (Companies) Rules, 1963\n\n(for short `the Rules').

In paragraphs 67 and 76 of the reply affidavit, it was averred that part\n\nof the project i.e. hotel is complete and has started functioning. In paragraph 79, it\n\nwas averred that besides the hotel project, cottages were proposed to be constructed\n\non plot bearing survey No.805 and the acquired land in survey Nos.803 and 804 will\n\nbe used for putting up health club, yoga centre, water sports and other recreational\n\nfacilities, which are integral part of the project.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_23\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_24\">(xii)      By an order dated 26.6.1984, Goa Bench of the High Court of Bombay\n\nallowed the writ petition and quashed the impugned notifications only on the ground\n\nof non compliance of Rule 4 of the Rules.

The applicant did not\n\nseek extension of hotel building to survey No.246/2 apparently because of the express\n\nembargo contained in Clause 4(viii) of the agreement that the company shall never\n\nconstruct any building or structure in the acquired land.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_44\">\n\n(xvi)      The aforementioned application was considered by the EEC in its 23rd\n\nmeeting held on 11.6.1987 and was favourably recommended subject to the condition\n\nthat pedestrian path along the beach may be made available by constructing an\n\naccess from the jetty so that public can reach the beach during the high tide period.\n\fThereafter, the matter was considered in the meeting of the EDC held on 11.9.1987\n\nand it was decided to accept the recommendations of the EEC, subject to the\n\ncondition regarding pedestrian path. The decision of the EDC was communicated to\n\nSmt.

Thus, for the first time, a\n\frequest was made for raising construction in survey No. 803 (new No.246/2) in the\n\ngarb of making deviation from the permission already granted. This application was\n\nnot put up either before the EEC or EDC and was straightaway considered by the\n\nGoa Town and Country Planning Board (for short `the Board') in its meeting held on\n\n20.6.1991 as an additional item and the following decision was taken:-\n\n\"The proposal relating to extension/deviation of Hotel Cidade de Goa which also\ninvolves relaxation in number of floors was considered and approved subject to the\ncondition that the height shall not exceed the stipulated limit of 17.5 mts. which was\napplicable at the time when the project was approved\".\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_50\">\n(xix)      The above reproduced decision of the Board was forwarded by the State\n\nGovernment to the Development Authority.         However, without even waiting for\n\nconsideration by the competent body, appellant No.1 appears to have started\n\nconstruction by deviating from the approved plan. This compelled the Chairman of\n\nthe Development Authority to send letter dated 12.7.1991 to appellant No.1 requiring\n\nit to refrain from going ahead with further construction.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_51\">\n\n(xx)       It is not borne out from the record that matter relating to extension of the\n\nhotel building on plot bearing survey No.803 (new No.246/2) was ever placed before\n\nthe EDC, but the Development Authority suo moto passed order dated 20.4.1992 vide\n\nwhich permission was granted to appellant No.1 to carry out the development on plot\n\nbearing survey No.246/1, 2, 3 and 4 subject to the terms and conditions specified\n\ntherein, including the following:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_52\">\"The condition No.10 of the Order No.PDA/T/7471/297/88 dated 15.4.1988 should be\nstrictly adhered to.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_53\">\n(xxi)      When appellant No.1 started extension of the hotel building in violation of\n\nthe permission accorded by the EDC, Shri Minguel Martins, who claims to have\n\npurchased plots carved out of survey No.792 (new No.242/1), popularly known as\n\n`Machado's Cove', filed Writ Petition No.330/1991, for issue of a direction to the\n\fState Government, Village Panchayat Taleigao and other official respondents to\n\nremove the illegal construction made by appellant No.1, to refrain from granting any\n\npermission for construction or regularizing the construction already made by\n\nappellant No.1 and also revoke the permission granted vide order dated 15.4.1988.\n\nHe further prayed for issue of a direction to respondent Nos.1 and 2 in the writ\n\npetition (appellants herein) to keep the traditional access to the beach open and not to\n\nput up any further construction on plots bearing survey Nos.787 and 803, which\n\nwould interfere with the public road, parking lot and public access to the beach. In\n\nparagraph 3 of his petition, Shri Minguel Martins made a mention of the alleged\n\nviolation of the conditions contained in letters dated 1.8.1978 and 22.8.1978 issued by\n\nthe Chief Town Planner and Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat respectively by\n\nasserting that respondent Nos.1 and 2 (appellants herein) have closed the road and\n\nfootpath to the beach and commenced construction of the parking, which he has been\n\nchallenged in Writ Petition No.284/1991.      In paragraphs 5 to 7, he referred to\n\nagreement dated 26.10.1983, and alleged that in complete violation of the mandate\n\nthereof, respondent Nos.1 and 2 have made construction in survey No.803 and\n\nblocked public access to the beach. He also pleaded that even though the land was\n\nacquired for sports and recreational facilities and use thereof for any other purpose\n\nis prohibited by the terms of agreement, the official respondents are trying to\n\nregularize illegal structures put up by respondent Nos.1 and 2 and even violation of\n\nCRZ is being ignored.      Another plea taken by Shri Minguel Martins was that\n\nrespondent Nos.1 and 2 have constructed sewerage treatment plant and laundry\n\nwithout obtaining permission from the competent authority under the Water\n\n(Prevention and <a href=\"/doc/82542966/\" id=\"a_18\">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and the <a href=\"/doc/182701402/\" id=\"a_19\">Environment Protection Act</a>,\n\n1986.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_54\">\n\n(xxii) In the reply affidavit filed on behalf of respondent Nos.1 and 2 in Writ Petition\n\fNo.330/1991 (appellants herein), it was pleaded that the petitioner is liable to be non-\n\nsuited on the ground of laches and also on the ground that disputed questions of fact\n\nare involved. It was further pleaded that the writ petition has been instituted with an\n\noblique motive at the instance of Dr. Alvaro de Souze Macahdo, one of the co-owners\n\nof survey No.792 and developer of Machado's Cove, namely, M/s. Alcon Real Estate\n\nPrivate Ltd., who filed Civil Suit No.67 of 1986 for similar relief but could not\n\npersuade Civil Judge, Junior Division, Panaji to entertain their prayer for temporary\n\ninjunction. The appellants alleged that after having failed to secure injunction from\n\nthe civil court, Victor Albuquerque, the partner of M/s. Alcon Real Estates Private\n\nLtd. filed Writ Petition No.284/1991 and Minguel Martins filed Writ Petition\n\nNo.330/1991 and this was indicative of the fact that the petitioner was in collusion\n\nwith the developer of Machado's Cove.        They also questioned, the locus of the\n\npetitioner by stating that plot bearing survey No.792 has not been sub-divided and he\n\ndoes not have any interest in that property. On merits it was averred that road, car\n\nparking facilities and footpath leading to the beach have been provided in accordance\n\nwith the condition imposed by the Chief Town Planner and Gram Panchayat and the\n\nsame are in existence since 1979 and are being used by the public without any\n\nobstruction. The appellants denied existence of a pathway through survey Nos.792\n\nand 803 and pleaded that members of the public do not have the right to access the\n\nbeach through survey No.803. The appellants also relied on <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 16</a> of the 1894 Act\n\nand averred that even if there existed access to the beach through the acquired land,\n\nthe same stood extinguished after vesting of the land in the government, possession of\n\nwhich was given to appellant No.1 on 26.3.1985. On the issue of extension of hotel\n\nbuilding, the appellants pleaded that additional construction was made in accordance\n\nwith the permission granted vide order dated 15.4.1988 and after obtaining approval\n\nof the proposed deviation from the competent authority. As regards, the laundry and\n\nwater treatment plant, it was averred that temporary sheds were constructed for\n\flaundry after obtaining permission from the Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat and\n\nthat treated effluent are intended to be used for gardening, manuring and other\n\npurposes for which no separate permission was necessary. The appellants referred to\n\nSuit No.313/1978/A filed by Gustavo Renato da Cruz Pinto and others for decree of\n\npossession by pre-emption and averred that the so called admissions made in the\n\nwritten statement about the existence of public pathway through plots bearing survey\n\nNos.792 and 803 is not binding on them because contents of the written statement\n\nwere not verified by the authorized representative of appellant No.2, on the basis of\n\npersonal knowledge and in their rejoinder, even the plaintiffs had not accepted the\n\nexistence of such pathway. In support of their plea that there is no public pathway or\n\naccess to the beach through survey Nos. 792 and 803, the appellants relied on the\n\njudgment of Special Civil Suit No. 67/1986 - Alvaro De Souza Machado and another\n\nvs. Sociedade De Fomento Industrial Pvt. Ltd. and another.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_55\">\n\n(xxiii) The Goa Foundation, which is the registered society and is engaged in the\n\nprotection of ecology and environment in the State of Goa and Dr. Claudo Alvares,\n\nSecretary of the Goa Foundation filed Writ Petition No.36/1992 with prayers similar\n\nto those made in Writ Petition No. 330/1991. They also invoked <a href=\"/doc/854952/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 51(g)</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India and pleaded that the Vainguinim beach, which is a public asset,\n\nis sought to be privatized by the respondents (appellants herein) and they have\n\nadvertised the hotel in foreign country as having a private beach. In paragraph 9 of\n\nWrit Petition No.36/1992, the petitioners claimed that the villagers of Taleigao and\n\ngeneral public have been using access to the beach that run through plots bearing\n\nsurvey Nos.792 and 803 (new Nos.242/1 and 246/2) in addition to the path running\n\nalong the boundary of survey No.787 (new No.246/1). They relied on the admissions\n\ncontained in the written statement filed on behalf of appellant No.2 in Special Civil\n\nSuit No.313/1978/A to show that public access to the beach exists through survey\n\fNo.803 and pleaded that in complete disregard of agreement dated 26.10.1983, the\n\nappellants have constructed hotel building without obtaining permission from the\n\ncompetent authority and they have unauthorisedly put up wall encircling those plots\n\nand thereby privatized Vainguinim beach.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_56\">\n\n(xxiv) Shri Gustavo Renato da Cruz Pinto, who had earlier filed Special Civil Suit\n\nNo.313/78/A for pre-emption, also joined the fray by filing Writ Petition No.141/1992.\n\nHe claimed that public access to the beach through plot bearing survey No.803 has\n\nbeen blocked in utter violation of the conditions specified in agreement dated\n\n26.10.1983. Another plea taken by Gustavo Renato da Cruz Pinto was that the land\n\nwas acquired under <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 40(1)(b)</a> of the 1894 Act and, therefore, the respondents\n\nin the writ petition are duty bound to provide amenities to the public in terms of\n\nagreement dated 26.10.1983, which they have failed to do.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_57\">\n\n(xxv)     The reply affidavits filed in Writ Petition Nos.36/1992 and 141/1992 were\n\nsubstantially similar to the counter filed in Writ Petition No.330/1991 except that in\n\nthe reply affidavit of Writ Petition No.36/1992, the appellants denied that they were\n\ntrying to privatize Vainguinim beach. They claimed that the disputed construction is\n\nlocated at a distance of 200 meters from high tide line and about 1000 meters from\n\nDona Paula jetty. According to the appellants, the beach in question is not a type of\n\ncoastal beach but has exclusiveness and in that sense it was advertised as a private\n\nbeach. While defending Writ Petition No.141/1992, Smt. Anju Timblo claimed that\n\nthere has been no violation of agreement dated 26.10.1983 and the construction has\n\nbeen made after obtaining permission from the competent authority.           She also\n\nenclosed permission granted by the Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat for putting up\n\ntemporary shed for washing machines.\n</p><p id=\"p_58\">\f(xxvi) A separate reply affidavit was filed by Shri Moraed Ahmed, Member Secretary\n\nof Development Authority in Writ Petition No.330/1991.          The substance of his\n\naffidavit was that the Development Authority has neither granted approval to the\n\ndeviation nor renewed the development permission of appellant No.1.           He also\n\nreferred to the illegal construction found at the time of inspections conducted on\n\n15.5.1990 and 14.5.1991 which blocked public access to the river or reduced its width\n\nand averred that on being asked to do so, appellant No.1 demolished the\n\nobstruction/illegal construction.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_59\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_60\">3.         At the hearing of the writ petitions, learned counsel appearing on behalf of\n\nthe petitioners did not press the grounds of challenge involving violation of CRZ\n\nRegulation and construction of sewerage treatment plant without obtaining\n\npermission/consent from the competent authority. After taking note of their\n\nstatement, the High Court considered other issues raised before it and held that the\n\nland was acquired under <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 40(1)(b)</a>; that the extension of the hotel building on\n\nan area measuring 1000 square meters of survey No.803 (new No.246/2) and other\n\nconstructions were legally impermissible. The High Court negatived the argument of\n\nthe appellants' counsel that in view of <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 16</a> of the 1894 Act encumbrance, if\n\nany, stood wiped out by observing that traditional public right of way cannot be\n\nstrictly treated as an encumbrance and existence of the way which was in use from\n\ntime immemorial by the public openly, peacefully and continuously can not be\n\naffected, more so, because in the agreement itself, access through survey No.803 (new\n\nNo.246/2) is acknowledged in the form of Clause 4(ix). The High Court also rejected\n\nthe explanations given by the appellants for advertising the beach as a private beach\n\nand held that they cannot obstruct the passage by putting up wall/barbed wire\n\nfencing. In the end, the High Court observed that after executing agreement dated\n\n26.10.1983, the State Government totally abandoned its duty and did not bother to\n\fensure compliance of the condition incorporated in it.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_61\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_62\">4.         On the aforesaid premise, the High Court allowed the writ petitions and\n\ngave the following directions:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">              a. The constructions which have come up in survey No.246/2 (old 803)\n                  are required to be demolished and the concerned authorities shall\n                  take action in this respect, within a period of eight weeks from\n                  today and the compliance report within two weeks therefrom.\n              b. A notice for resumption of the land as required under proviso to\n                  clause 6 of the agreement dated 26.10.1983 shall be issued within\n                  ten weeks by the Government to the hotel to show cause as to why,\n                  in the circumstances, the acquired land should not be resumed.\n                  The Government shall then take appropriate decision in accordance\n                  with law.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">              c. The access which is shown in plan Exh.A colly which is at page 33\n                  of Writ Petition No.141 of 1992 shall be kept open without any\n                  obstruction of any kind from point A-B in order to come from\n                  Machado Cove side from point A to 803 (246/2 new) and then to go\n                  to the beach beyond point B. We have already pointed out that this\n                  plan is to the scale.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">              d. The challenge relating to yellow access and shifting the same to\n                  purple access which is raised in Writ Petition No.330/91 has been\n                  exhaustively dealt with in separate judgment in connected Writ\n                  Petitions No.284/91 and 37/92 and the order passed therein shall\n                  govern the said challenge.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">\n\n</blockquote><p id=\"p_63\">5.         Before proceeding further, we consider it necessary to mention that during\n\nthe pendency of these appeals, the appellants filed I.As. for permission to file\n\nadditional documents including copy of the agreement entered into between plot\n\nowners/developers of Machado's Cove (old survey No.792) with plot purchasers\n\nshowing the pathway to be maintained in terms of order dated 9.4.1992 passed in\n\nW.P. No.141/1992, photographs showing the pathway and extension of the hotel\n\fbuilding on survey No.803 (new No.246/2) which is partly occupied by health club,\n\ngymnasium, beauty parlour, barber shop, steam, sauna, video games arcade and\n\naerobics and part of circulation hall, kitchen etc., photograph showing development\n\nof garden in survey No.803, a sketch showing the location of path as per Exhibit A,\n\ncopies of correspondence between the developer and appellant No.1 on the one hand\n\nand functionaries of the State Government and Gram Panchayat on the other hand,\n\norders of the Development Authority, letter dated 12.7.1991 of the Chairman of the\n\nDevelopment Authority, pleadings of and/or evidence produced by the parties in\n\nSpecial Civil Suit Nos.313/1978/A and 67/1986 and the judgment of Special Civil Suit\n\nNo.67/1986.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_64\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_65\">6.        It is also apposite to mention that while issuing notice in Writ Petition\n\nNo.141/1992, the High Court passed an interim order directing appellant No.1 to\n\nmaintain the public access from point `A' to `B' in survey No.803 (new No.246/2). In\n\nthe special leave petitions, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the directions contained in High\n\nCourt's order and action initiated for resumption of the land were stayed, but at the\n\nsame time, the Court recorded that learned counsel for the petitioner has agreed that\n\npathway from point `A' to `B' in survey No.246/2 as shown at page 49 of Volume II of\n\nthe paper book in SLP (C) No.9875/2000 shall be maintained till further orders, [This\n\npage is a plan showing the status of various plots including survey No.803 (new\n\nNo.246/2) through which the public path passes from point `A' to `B'].\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_66\">7.        Shri Anil B. Divan, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant,\n\nargued that land in survey Nos.803 and 804 was acquired under <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 40(1)(aa)</a>\n\nand not under <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 40(1)(b)</a> of the 1894 Act and the High Court committed serious\n\nerror in recording a finding that the acquisition was under <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 40(1)(b)</a>. Learned\n\nsenior counsel submitted that the expression \"public purpose\" appearing in clause\n\f(aa) of <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 40(1)</a> is relatable to the purpose of company and not as the term is\n\ngenerally understood in the context of the provisions contained in Part II of the 1894\n\nAct. Shri Divan further submitted that in the absence of a specific stipulation to that\n\neffect in the notification published under <a href=\"/doc/875938/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 4(1)</a> of the 1894 Act and agreement\n\ndated 26.10.1983, the High Court was not justified in issuing a mandamus for\n\nproviding access to the beach through that survey number. An alternative argument\n\nof Shri Divan is that the so called public access to the beach through survey No.803\n\nwas running parallel to the nallah dividing survey No.803 on the one hand and\n\nsurvey Nos.804 and 805 on the other hand and no useful purpose will be served by\n\ninsisting on maintaining that access because new path has been made available for\n\naccess to the beach by constructing road, car parking, etc. in compliance of the\n\ncondition imposed by the Chief Town Planner in his letter dated 1.8.1978 and by the\n\nGram Panchayat while granting permission for construction of hotel in survey\n\nNo.787. Learned senior counsel referred to the affidavit filed on behalf of the State\n\nGovernment before this Court and argued that when parties to the agreement have\n\nclearly understood the terms thereof and the EDC gave permission for construction\n\nof sports facilities and amenities without insisting that the same should be allowed to\n\nbe used by members of the public, except on paying the specified fees, the High Court\n\ncommitted an error by issuing a mandamus for resumption of the land on the ground\n\nof the alleged violation of agreement dated 26.10.1983.        Learned senior counsel\n\nextensively referred to the pleadings of three writ petitions and additional documents\n\nfiled in these appeals to show that hotel building was extended on plot bearing survey\n\nNo.803, after obtaining permission from the EDC and Development Authority and\n\nsubmitted that the irregularity, if any, committed in that regard will be deemed to\n\nhave been regularized by order dated 20.4.1992 passed by the Development\n\nAuthority. Shri Divan relied on Clause 6 of the agreement and argued that even if\n\nthe appellants can be said to have violated any of the conditions of agreement, it is for\n\fthe Government to take action for resumption of the land, after giving opportunity to\n\nthem to rectify the defect, etc. and the High Court could not have usurp the power of\n\nthe Government and directed demolition of the disputed construction.         Learned\n\nsenior counsel also referred to judgment dated 13.3.2006 passed in Special Civil Suit\n\nNo.67/1986 and argued that in the face of unequivocal finding recorded by the\n\ncompetent court that there is no pathway from survey No.792 (Machado's Cove) to\n\nsurvey No.803, the direction given by the High Court for resumption of the land on\n\nthe ground that access to the beach available to the public through survey No.803\n\n(new No.246/2) has been blocked in violation of the terms of agreement dated\n\n26.10.1983, is liable to be set aside. He further argued that the so-called admissions\n\nmade in the written statement filed in Special Civil Suit No.313/78/A cannot be read\n\nagainst the appellants because the written statement was not signed by authorized\n\nrepresentative of appellant No.2 on personal knowledge and, in any case, the finding\n\nrecorded by the competent court in Special Civil Suit No.67/1986 should be treated as\n\nconclusive on the issue of non-existence of passage through survey No.803.         In\n\nsupport of this argument, learned senior counsel relied on the judgment of this Court\n\nin Nagubai Ammal &amp; ors. Vs. B. Shama Rao &amp; ors. [(1956) SCR 451] and of\n\nAllahabad High Court in <a href=\"/doc/1003986/\" id=\"a_30\">Anurag Misra vs. Ravindra Singh and another</a> [AIR 1994\n\nAllahabad 124].\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_67\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_68\">8.        Shri Pallav Shihsodia, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nState of Goa and other official respondent, adopted the arguments of Shri Anil Divan\n\nand submitted that right of the public to use the traditional passage through private\n\nland bearing survey No.803 (new No.246/2) could, at the best, be treated as\n\neasementary right which stood extinguished with the acquisition of land under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/875938/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 4(1)</a> of the 1894 Act, and vesting thereof in the State Government in terms of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 16</a>. Shri Shishodia referred to the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the\n\fState in these appeals and submitted that once possession of the acquired land was\n\ntaken by the Government free from all encumbrances, the writ petitioners could not\n\nhave asked for an access to the beach through survey No.803 for members of the\n\npublic. He submitted that if public is allowed to use survey No.803, there will always\n\nbe a possibility of threat to the security of the inmates of the hotel, which will affect\n\ninflow of tourist in the area and have adverse impact on the economy of the State.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_69\">9.         Ms. Indira Jaising, learned senior counsel for the Goa Foundation,\n\nreferred to notification dated 29.10.1980 and agreement dated 26.10.1983 to show\n\nthat the land in dispute was acquired for execution of work for the benefit of general\n\npublic and argued that the High Court did not commit any error by recording a\n\nfinding that the acquisition was under <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 40(1)(b)</a>.      She pointed out that the\n\nland was acquired with the sole object of enabling appellant No.1 to develop sports\n\nand recreational facilities/amenities which could be used by the occupants of the hotel\n\nrooms as also the general public and argued that the same cannot be said to be for the\n\npurposes of the company. Ms. Jaising emphasised that on the date of acquisition, the\n\nappellant No.1 had already constructed the hotel and argued that in the garb of\n\ncreating facilities and amenities for the occupants of the hotel rooms, it could not\n\nhave extended hotel building on 1000 sq. meters of plot bearing survey No.803, and\n\nthat too in violation of the express bar contained in Clause 4(viii) of agreement dated\n\n26.10.1983.   She argued that order dated 20.4.1992 passed by the Development\n\nAuthority permitting construction on plot bearing survey No.803 is liable to be\n\nignored in view of Clause 4(viii) of the agreement. She further argued that even if\n\nthis Court comes to the conclusion that appellant no.1 could construct building on\n\nsurvey No.803 by way of extension of the existing hotel, the disputed construction\n\ncannot be saved because permission of the EDC was not obtained. Ms. Jaising\n\ninvoked the doctrine of public trust and argued that in view of the unequivocal\n\fcondition incorporated in Clause 4(ix) of the agreement that access to the beach will\n\nbe maintained without any obstruction, right of the members of public to go to the\n\nbeach through survey No.803 cannot be stultified by putting up wall/barbed wire\n\nfencing or by creating any other impediment. Learned senior counsel submitted that\n\nthe beach in question is not a private beach and, therefore, the public at large cannot\n\nbe denied the right to access the beach. She further submitted that if appellants are\n\nallowed to prevent the public from going to the beach through the traditional path\n\nfrom Dona-Paola-Bambolim Road through survey Nos.792 and 803, the same would\n\namount to privatization of the public beach, which is legally impermissible.         As\n\nregards the judgment in Special Civil Suit No.67/1986, Ms. Jaising submitted that the\n\nsame is not relevant for deciding the issues raised in these appeals because neither\n\nany of the writ petitioners nor the State Government were parties to that litigation\n\nand, in any case, in view of the unequivocal stipulation contained in Clause 4(ix) of\n\nthe agreement, appellant No.1 cannot wriggle out of its statutory obligation to\n\nmaintain passage through plot bearing survey No.803. She countered the submission\n\nof Shri Divan that in view of the availability of alternative access to the beach\n\nthrough the road, car parking and footpath constructed by appellant No.1, the High\n\nCourt should not have insisted on continuing access to the beach through survey No.\n\n803 by asserting that the said access has been provided in terms of letter dated\n\n1.8.1978 of the Chief Town Planner and permission granted by the Gram Panchayat\n\nvide letter dated 22.8.1978 in lieu of the access available to the public through survey\n\nNo.787 and the same cannot be made basis for depriving members of the public to\n\ncontinue to avail access to the beach through the traditional path available to them\n\nsurvey No. 803. Learned senior counsel also pointed out that the alternative access is\n\ntotally illusory because it ends on the rocks through which no person can easily go to\n\nthe beach.\n</p><p id=\"p_70\">\f10.

The decision of this question depends on the interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_37\">Sections 40</a>\n\n(1) and 41 of the 1894 Act. However, before adverting to those sections, we deem it\n\nproper to notice other relevant provisions. <a href=\"/doc/875938/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 4</a> provides for publication of a\n\fpreliminary notification evidencing prima facie satisfaction of the government that\n\nland in any locality is needed or is likely to be needed for any public purpose. This\n\nsection prescribes the mode of publication of notification and also indicates the steps\n\nwhich could be taken for survey etc. of the land for deciding whether the same is fit\n\nfor the purpose for which it is needed. <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 5A</a> postulates giving of an opportunity\n\nto any person interested in the land to raise objection against proposed acquisition\n\nand casts a duty on the Collector to hear the objector in person and submit his report\n\nto the Government.      <a href=\"/doc/587621/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 6</a> postulates making of a declaration containing\n\nsatisfaction of the appropriate Government arrived at, after considering the report, if\n\nany, made under <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 5A(2)</a> that the particular land is needed for a public\n\npurpose or for a company. This is subject to the provisions of Part VII of the Act.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 39</a>, which finds place in Part VII, lays down that the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/587621/\" id=\"a_43\">Sections 6</a>\n\nto <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_44\">37</a> (both inclusive) shall not be put in force for acquiring land on behalf of a\n\ncompany under that part without the previous consent of the appropriate\n\nGovernment, and unless the company executes an agreement in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 41</a>.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_73\">12.        <a href=\"/doc/1981888/\" id=\"a_46\">In R.L. Arora vs. State of U.P</a>. [(1962) Suppl. 2 SCR 149] (hereinafter\n\nreferred to as `first R.L. Arora case'), the Constitution Bench considered the legality\n\nof the acquisition made on behalf of Lakshmi Ratan Engineering Works Limited,\n\nKanpur, which was engaged in manufacture of textile machinery parts.               The\n\nappellant, who was owner of the land, challenged the acquisition on the ground that\n\nit was not for a public purpose. It was argued on behalf of the appellant that the\n\nimpugned acquisition cannot be treated to have been made under <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 40(1)(b)</a>,\n\nmerely because the products of the company, for which land is sought to be acquired\n\nwill be useful to the public. It was urged that, if <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 40(1)</a> is given such an\n\ninterpretation, the Government will become an agent for acquiring lands on behalf of\n\nthe companies engaged in producing something which may be used by the public.\n\fThe respondents argued that <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 40(1)(b)</a> is of wide amplitude and land can be\n\nacquired under the Act for any company when the work set up by it is likely to prove\n\nuseful to the public. The majority of the Constitution Bench held that <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 40(1)</a>\n\n</p><p id=\"p_74\">(b) must be read in conjunction with <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 41</a> to find out the intention of the\n\nlegislature when it provides for acquisition of land for a company through the agency\n\nof the Government, and rejected the argument of the respondents by making the\n\nfollowing observations:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_75\">\n\n\"............ If we were to give the wide interpretation contended for on behalf of the\nrespondents on the relevant words in<a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_52\"> ss. 40</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_53\">41</a> it would amount to holding that\nthe legislature intended the Government to be a sort of general agent for companies\nto acquire lands for them, so that there owners may make profits. It can hardly be\ndenied that a company which will satisfy the definition of that word in<a href=\"/doc/82904/\" id=\"a_54\"> s. 3(e)</a> will be\nproducing something or other which will be useful to the public and which the public\nmay need to purchase. So on the wide interpretation contended for on behalf of the\nrespondents, we must come to the conclusion that the intention of the legislature was\nthat the Government should be an agent for acquiring land for all companies for such\npurposes as they might have provided the product intended to be produced is in a\ngeneral manner useful to the public, and if that is so there would be clearly no point\nin providing the restrictive provisions in<a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_55\"> ss. 40</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_56\">41</a>. The very fact therefore that\nthe power to use the machinery of the Act for the acquisition of land for a company is\nconditioned by the restrictions in<a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_57\"> ss. 40</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_58\">41</a> indicates that the legislature intended\nthat land should be acquired through the coercive machinery of the Act only for the\nrestricted purpose mentioned in<a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_59\"> ss. 40</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_60\">41</a>, which would also be a public purpose\nfor the purpose of<a href=\"/doc/875938/\" id=\"a_61\"> s. 4</a>. ......................\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_76\">\n\"Let us therefore turn to the words of<a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_62\"> s. 40(1)(b)</a>, which says that acquisition should\nbe for some work which is likely to prove useful to the public. Now if the legislature\nintended these words to mean that even where the product of the work is useful to the\npublic, land can be acquired for the company for that purpose, the legislature could\nhave easily used the words \"the product of\" before the words \"such work\". The very\nfact that there is no reference to the product of the work in<a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_63\"> s. 40(1)(b)</a> shows that\nwhen the legislature said that the work should be likely to prove useful to the public\nit meant that the work should be directly useful to the public through the public\nbeing able to use it instead of being indirectly useful to the public through the public\nbeing able to use its product. We have no doubt therefore that when<a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_64\"> s. 40(1)(b)</a> says\nthat the work should be useful to the public it means that it should be directly useful\nto the public which should be able to make use of it. This meaning in our opinion is\nmade perfectly clear by what is provided in the fifth term in<a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_65\"> s. 41</a>. Before the\nmachinery of the Act can be put into operation to acquire land for a company, the\nGovernment has to take an agreement from the company, and that agreement must\nprovide, where acquisition is needed for the construction of some work and that work\nis likely to prove useful to the public, the terms on which the public shall be entitled\nto use the work. ........\"\n</p><p id=\"p_77\">\f13.        With a view to over come the difficulty created in the acquisition of land\n\nfor private companies on account of the judgment in first R.L. Arora's case, Clause\n\n(aa) was inserted in <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 40(1)</a> by the <a href=\"/doc/41392/\" id=\"a_67\">Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act</a>, 1961.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 40</a> (as it stands after 1961 amendment) and <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_69\">Sections 41</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_70\">42</a> of the 1894 Act\n\nread as under:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_78\">\n\n\"40.

Publication of agreement.- Every such agreement shall, as soon as may be after\nits execution, be published in the Official Gazette, and thereupon (so far as regards\nthe terms on which the public shall be entitled to use the work) have the same effect\nas if it had formed part of this Act.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_87\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_88\">14.       In this case, we are not concerned with Clause (a) of <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 40(1)</a> because\n\nthe land in survey Nos.803 (new No.246/2) and 8042 (new No. 245/2) was not acquired\n\nfor erection of dwelling houses for workmen employed by appellant No.1 or for\n\nprovision of amenities directly connected therewith.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_89\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_90\">15.       The dispute between the parties centers round the remaining two clauses\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 40(1)</a>. According to the appellants, the acquisition was under Clause (aa),\n\nwhereas writ-petitioners (private respondents herein) pleaded that the acquisition\n\nwas under Clause (b). A careful reading of the two clauses shows that while Clause\n\n(aa) envisages acquisition for the construction of some building or work for a\n\ncompany which is engaged or is taking steps for engaging itself in any industry or\n\fwork which is for a public purpose, Clause (b) refers to acquisition for construction\n\nof some work which is likely to prove useful to the public. The difference in the\n\nlanguage of the two clauses clearly brings out this distinction. In the second part of\n\nClause (aa), the legislature has used the expression `in any industry or work which is\n\nfor a public purpose'. This means that the particular acquisition can be treated to\n\nhave been made under that clause if it is for construction of some building or work\n\nfor a company which is engaged or is likely to engage itself in any industry or work\n\nwhich may not necessarily be useful to the public in general.          As against this,\n\nusefulness of the construction of some work to the general public is sine qua non for\n\nacquisition under Clause (b). The expression \"public purpose\" used in Clause (aa)\n\nwas interpreted in <a href=\"/doc/1521043/\" id=\"a_77\">R.L. Arora vs. State of Uttar Pradesh &amp; others</a> [(1964] 6 SCR 784]\n\n(herein after referred to \"second R.L. Arora's case\") which was instituted by the\n\nland owner for striking down the amendment made in 1961 for validating the\n\nacquisition, which was quashed in the first R.L. Arora's case. It was argued on\n\nbehalf of the petitioner that even if the amendment was not treated ultra vires the\n\nprovisions of the Constitution, the disputed acquisition is liable to be annulled\n\nbecause the condition prescribed in Clause (aa) of <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 40(1)</a> was not fulfilled,\n\ninasmuch as the acquisition was not for a public purpose. It was submitted that\n\nunless there was any direct connection or close nexus between the articles produced\n\nby the company and general good of the public, the impugned acquisition cannot be\n\ntreated as covered by Clause (aa). The majority of the Constitution Bench rejected\n\nthis argument and held:-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_91\">\n\"In approaching the question of construction of this clause, it cannot be forgotten\nthat the amendment was made in consequence of the decision of this Court in R.L.\nArora case and the intention of Parliament was to fill the lacuna, which, according to\nthat decision, existed in the Act in the matter of acquisitions for a company ....\nFurther, a literal interpretation is not always the only interpretation of a provision in\na statute and the court has to look at the setting in which the words are used and the\ncircumstances in which the law came to be passed to decide whether there is\nsomething implicit behind the words actually used which would control the literal\nmeaning of the words used in a provision of the statute.\n</p><pre id=\"pre_3\">\f           *                                                                 *\n                                                                  *\n           *\n</pre><p id=\"p_92\">Therefore, we have to see whether the provision in clause (aa) bears another\nconstruction also in the setting in which it appears and in the circumstances in which\nit was put on the statute book and also in view of the language used in the clause. The\ncircumstances in which the amendment came to be made have already been\nmentioned by us and the intention of Parliament clearly was to fill up the lacuna in\nthe Act which became evident on the decision of this Court in R.L. Arora case . . . . It\nwas only for such a company that land was to be acquired compulsorily and the\nacquisition was for the construction of some building or work for such a company i.e.\na company engaged or about to be engaged in some industry or work which is for a\npublic purpose. In this setting it seems to us reasonable to hold that the intention of\nParliament could only have been that land should be acquired for such building or\nwork for a company as would subserve the public purpose of the company; it could not\nhave been intended, considering the setting in which clause (aa) was introduced, that\nland could be acquired for a building or work which would not subserve the public\npurpose of the company .... Further, acquisition is for the construction of some\nbuilding or work for a company and the nature of that company is that it is engaged\nor is taking steps for engaging itself in any industry or work which is for a public\npurpose. When therefore the building or work is for such a company it seems to us\nthat it is reasonable to hold that the nature of the building or work to be constructed\ntakes colour from the nature of the company for which it is to be constructed. We are\ntherefore of opinion that the literal and mechanical construction for which the\npetitioner contends is neither the only nor the true construction of clause (aa) and\nthat when clause (aa) provides for acquisition of land needed for construction of some\nbuilding or work it implicitly intends that the building or work which is to be\nconstructed must be such as to subserve the public purpose of the industry or work in\nwhich the company is engaged or is about to be engaged. In short, the words `building\nor work' used in clause (aa) take their colour from the adjectival clause which\ngoverns the company for which the building; or work is being constructed . . . . It is\nonly in these cases where the company is engaged in an industry or work of that kind\nand where the building or work is also constructed for a purpose of that kind, which\nis a public purpose, that acquisition can be made under clause (aa). As we read the\nclause we are of opinion that the public purpose of the company for which acquisition\nis to be made cannot be divorced from the purpose of the building or work and it is\nnot open for such a company to acquire land under clause (aa) for a building or work\nwhich will not subserve the public purpose of the company\".\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_93\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_94\">16.        The same question was again considered in <a href=\"/doc/658418/\" id=\"a_79\">State of West Bengal and\n\nanother vs. Surendra Nath Bhattacharya and another</a> [(1980) 3 SCC 237]. In that\n\ncase, acquisition was made on behalf of a company which was carrying on the\n\nbusiness of manufacturing of sodium silicate, plaster of paris etc. The manufactured\n\ngoods of the company were widely used all over India, saving large amount of foreign\n\nexchange which was earlier used for importing similar goods. The Division Bench of\n\fCalcutta High Court quashed the acquisition on the ground that it was not for a\n\npublic purpose. After noticing the majority judgment in second R.L. Arora's case,\n\nthe Court held:-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_95\">\n \"The effect of the observations made above leads to the irresistible conclusion that\nthe words \"public purpose\" are not to be interpreted in a restricted sense but takes\ncolour from the nature of the industry itself, the articles that it manufactures and the\nbenefit to the people that it subserves. This Court clearly indicated that the land\nshould be acquired for building or work which would serve the public purpose of the\ncompany and not public purpose as it is generally understood. In the instant case, we\nhave also set out the nature of the products of the company and have stressed the fact\nthat the articles produced by the company are used for the benefit of the people and\nas it saves lot of foreign exchange, it is unmistakably for the general good of the\ncountry particularly from the economic point of view. In these circumstances, it\ncannot be said that the object of the company in extending its operations by enlarging\nthe area of its production was not for the public purpose of the company. Taking an\noverall picture of the nature of the products of the company, its various activities, the\ngeneral public good that it seeks to achieve and the great benefit that the people\nderive, it cannot be said that the acquisition, in the present case, was not for a public\npurpose. According to the test laid down by this Court, it is sufficient if it is shown\nthat the building sought to be built or the work undertaken subserves the public\npurpose of the company which is completely fulfilled in this case.\"\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_96\">17.              <a href=\"/doc/1045847/\" id=\"a_80\">In Pratibha Nema and others vs. State of M.P. and others</a> [(2003) 10 SCC\n\n626], this Court analysed the provisions of Part II and VII of the 1894 Act, referred\n\nto the earlier judgments in Somwanti vs. State of Punjab [AIR 1963 SC 151], second\n\nR.L. Arora's case, <a href=\"/doc/20367/\" id=\"a_81\">Jage Ram vs. State of Haryana</a> [(1971) 1 SCC 671], <a href=\"/doc/588752/\" id=\"a_82\">Bajirao T.\n\nKote vs. State of Maharashtra</a> [(1995) 2 SCC 442] and observed:-\n\n\n\"These decisions establish that a public purpose is involved in the acquisition of land\nfor setting up an industry in the private sector as it would ultimately benefit the\npeople. However, we would like to add that any and every industry need not\nnecessarily promote public purpose and there could be exceptions which negate the\npublic purpose. But, it must be borne in mind that the satisfaction of the Government\nas to the existence of public purpose cannot be lightly faulted and it must remain\nuppermost in the mind of the court.\n</p><p id=\"p_97\">..............\n</p><p id=\"p_98\">Thus the distinction between public purpose acquisition and Part VII acquisition has\ngot blurred under the impact of judicial interpretation of relevant provisions. The\nmain and perhaps the decisive distinction lies in the fact whether the cost of\nacquisition comes out of public funds wholly or partly. Here again, even a token or\nnominal contribution by the Government was held to be sufficient compliance with\n\fthe second proviso to <a href=\"/doc/587621/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 6</a> as held in a catena of decisions. The net result is that\nby contributing even a trifling sum, the character and pattern of acquisition could be\nchanged by the Government. In ultimate analysis, what is considered to be an\nacquisition for facilitating the setting up of an industry in the private sector could get\nimbued with the character of public purpose acquisition if only the Government\ncomes forward to sanction the payment of a nominal sum towards compensation. In\nthe present state of law, that seems to be the real position.\"\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_99\">18.        <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 41</a> lays down that if the appropriate Government is satisfied, after\n\nconsidering the report, if any, of the Collector under <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 5A(2)</a> or on the report of\n\nthe officer making an inquiry under <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 40</a>, that the proposed acquisition is for\n\nany of the purposes referred to in clause (a) or (aa) or clause (b) of sub-section (1) of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 40</a>, then it shall require the company to enter into an agreement on the\n\nmatters enumerated in Clauses 1 to 5. Clause 4(A) of <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 41</a>, which is relatable to\n\nan acquisition under <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 40(1)(aa)</a>, requires that the agreement must indicate the\n\ntime within which and the conditions on which the building or work shall be\n\nconstructed or executed. Clause (5) of <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 41</a>, which is relatable to an acquisition\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 40(1)(b)</a>, also postulates indication of time within which work is\n\nexecuted or maintained and the terms on which public shall be entitled to use the\n\nwork.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_100\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_101\">19.        <a href=\"/doc/1252016/\" id=\"a_92\">In State of West Bengal vs. P.N. Talukdar</a> [AIR 1965 SC 646] this Court\n\nconsidered a question similar to question No.1 framed by us and observed:\n\n\n\n\"..... Generally speaking the appropriate government would not state in so many\nwords whether it was proceeding under Clause (a), or Clause (aa) or Clause (b). The\nquestion whether consent has been given under one clause or the other or more than\none clause has to be decided on the basis of the agreement and the notification under\n<a href=\"/doc/587621/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 6</a>. We have also no doubt that it is open to the appropriate government to give\nconsent on being satisfied as to one of the three clauses only or as to more than one\nclause. In the present case reliance has been placed on behalf of the State\nGovernment on all the three clauses and particularly on clauses (aa) and (b), to show\nthat the consent was given after keeping in mind all the three clauses of <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 40(1)</a>.\nThe question as to which clause of <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 40(1)</a> was acted upon by the State\nGovernment to give consent is important because on that will depend the nature of\nthe agreement which has to be made under <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_96\">Section 41</a>. Where the purpose of the\n\facquisition is as mentioned in Clause (a), the agreement has to provide for the time\nwithin which, the conditions on which and the manner in which the dwelling houses\nor amenities shall be erected or provided. Where the consent is based on Clause (aa),\nthe agreement is to provide for the time within which and the conditions on which,\nthe building or work shall be constructed or executed. Where the consent is given on\nthe basis of Clause (b), the agreement, is to specify the time within which and the\nconditions on which the work shall be executed and maintained, and the terms on\nwhich the public shall be entitled to use the work. It will be seen from the above that\nthere are bound to be differences in the terms to be embodied in an agreement under\n<a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 41</a> depending upon whether the consent was given.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_102\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_103\">20.        In the light of the above, we shall now consider whether on a conjoint\n\nreading of notification dated 29.10.1980 and agreement dated 26.10.1983, acquisition\n\nof survey Nos.803 and 804 (new Nos.246/2 and 245/2) can be treated as having been\n\nmade under <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 40(1)(aa)</a> or it was an acquisition under 40(1)(b) of the 1894 Act.\n\nA brief recapitulation of the facts shows that soon after commencing work for\n\nconstruction of the hotel, appellant No.1 approached the State Government for\n\nacquisition of land comprised in various survey numbers including survey Nos.803\n\nand 804 (new Nos.246/2 and 245/2) by indicating that the first phase of its project\n\nenvisages construction of hotel building in survey No.787 and in the second phase, it\n\nwas intending to put up a yoga centre, health club and water sports facilities in\n\nsurvey No.805 for promoting tourism, which will also be useful to the general public.\n\nAppellant No.1 pointed out that two small plots bearing survey Nos.788 and 789,\n\nabutting the beach, are required for installing a first aid post and a medical aid\n\ncentre, which are necessary for beach resort hotel and for providing safety measures\n\nand facilities to the residents of the hotel and also for the public at large, using the\n\nbeach. Appellant No.1 then submitted that for second phase of the hotel complex, it\n\nwill be desirable to acquire survey Nos.803 and 804 so that the entire complex will\n\nbecome one composite unit. In the end, appellant No.1 indicated that the facilities\n\nprovided by the hotel will be open for use to the non-residents on membership basis.\n\nThe notification issued by the State Government under <a href=\"/doc/875938/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 4(1)</a> shows that the\n\fland was needed for a public purpose, namely, the tourism development project -\n\nconstruction of hotel at Curla, Vainguinim, Taleigao. In our view, as appellant No.1\n\nwas engaged in executing a project of tourism development, i.e., construction of hotel\n\nalong with amenities like yoga centre, health club and water sports facilities,\n\nacquisition of survey Nos.803 and 804 (new Nos.246/2 and 245/2) was clearly\n\nrelatable to its project. This is also borne out from the language of agreement dated\n\n26.10.1983, which records satisfaction of the Government that the land was needed\n\nfor the purpose of executing tourism development project of appellant No.1. Clause 4\n\n</p><p id=\"p_104\">(ii) of the agreement shows that appellant No.1 was required to undertake the work\n\nof creation of sports and recreational facilities / amenities within one year of getting\n\npossession and complete the same within three years.         This work was certainly\n\nancillary to the tourism development project being executed by appellant No.1.\n\nTherefore, there is no escape from the conclusion that the acquisition was under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 40(1)(aa)</a> of the 1894 Act and the contrary finding recorded by the High\n\nCourt is legally unsustainable. It is also necessary to bear in mind that tourism is an\n\nimportant industrial activity in Goa which attracts tourists from all over the country\n\nand abroad. A huge amount of foreign exchange is generated by this industry apart\n\nfrom providing employment and ancillary benefits to a large section of the population\n\nof the State.   Therefore, acquisition of land for tourism development project is\n\ncertainly for a public purpose.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_105\">\nRe: 2\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_106\">21.        For deciding the question whether public access to the beach was available\n\nthrough survey No.803 (new No.246/2) before its acquisition in the year 1980, it will\n\nbe profitable to notice the pleadings of the parties and contents of the documents\n\nproduced by them. In all the writ petitions, the petitioners claimed that there exists\n\npassage through survey No.803 which is being used by the public for many years for\n\fgoing to the beach. In para 6 of his writ petition, Minguel Martins referred to the\n\naffidavit of Avdhut Kamat filed by appellant No.2 in civil suit for a decree of pre-\n\nemption instituted by Gustavo Renato da Cruz Pinto and two others. In other two\n\npetitions, the writ petitioners relied on the averments contained in the written\n\nstatement filed on behalf of appellant No.2 in Special Civil Suit No.313/1978/A to\n\nsupport their assertion regarding existence of access to the beach through survey\n\nNo.803. Gustavo Renato da Cruz Pinto also placed on record a copy of the affidavit\n\nof Avdhut Kamat and plan prepared by him showing access to the beach from point\n\n`A' to `B' in survey No.803. In that plan starting point of access from the beach was\n\nat point `B' in survey No.803 and it ended at point `A' touching northern boundary\n\nof that survey number towards Machado's Cove.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_107\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_108\">22.        In paragraphs 2F to 2O, 2R, 2S, 3E and 3H of the written statement filed\n\non behalf of appellant No.2 in Special Civil Suit No.313/1978/A, the following\n\naverments were made:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_109\">\n\"2F.       As shown before, the properties 803, 804, 787, 788, 789 and 805 are\nbounded on the South by seashore beyond which the river zuari lies. A part of this\nshore which forms the boundary to the said properties is used as public way. This\npublic way after passing through the seashore and some private road goes upto Dona\nPaula jotty. This, public way is used by the members of the public including the\nfisher folk to go from th said seashore upto Dona Paula jetty and vice-versa, from\ntime immemorial, without objection whosoever, openly, peacefully and continuously\nand as a matter of right.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_110\">2G.         The beach existing at the south of property 803 and 787 is a public resort\nand it is visited by members of the public from all parts of llhas Taluka. For this\npurpose there is a ramp (stone construction) built on the ground in property 803 as a\nmeans of access to the beach. There is also a similar ramp in the property 787. The\nexistence of the ramps and the date of their construction is lost in antiquity but has\nbeen known to exist at least for the last seventy years.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_111\">2H.        In order to have access to the portion of the beach existing in the property\n803, there is a footpath starting from the ramp and going towards North upto the\nculvert linking property 803 with property 792 of Machado therefrom after crossing\nthe property of Machado in the same direction, it touches the public footpath going\nfrom Dona Paula to Calapur. At present, the said footpath touches the Panaji-Dona\nPaula-Bambolim road and crosses the property of Machado.\n</p><p id=\"p_112\">\f2I.       The way mentioned in the proceeding para 2H is being used by members\nof the public living in the village Calapur and also by other members of the public\ncoming from different parts of Taluka llhas. This way is clearly visible on site.\n\n2J.         The Plaintiffs family have access to the properties 803, 804, 788 and 789\nthrough the said way mentioned in para 2H and they have been using this access for\nthe last fifty years. The family of the Plaintiffs have their residential house at St.\nCruz village and this way in the nearest way for them.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_113\">2K.       The access to the property 788 and 789 of the Plaintiff's family is through\nthe property 803 and through the portion of the beach used as a public way and\nstanding on the Southern side.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_114\">2L. The access to the property 804 is through the property 803 and for that purpose\nthere exists a culvert.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_115\">2M.        The access to the property 806 is in the continuation of the way leading\nfrom 803 and 804 and then going to the beach and to property 806. 806 has also\ndirect access to the seashore which is used as public way.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_116\">2N.       It is not true that that the way to 806 goes from property 805 as\nrepresented in the map annexed to the Plaint.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_117\">2O.            The access to the property 807 is through the property of Machadio\nSurvey No. 792 and more particularly the way which goes just in line with the\nEastern boundary of property of Machado. This latter was given access also to\nproperty 806 after passing through properties which stand at the East of property\n807 and 805. As represented in the map annexed to the Plaint, 807 has access\nthrough 804 and 803.\n</p><p id=\"p_118\">.................\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_119\">2R.        The members of the public coming through the way mentioned in Para 2P\nwere using either the portion of beach in property 787 or portion of beach in\nproperty 803. Whenever they were using the ramp existing in the property 803, they\nused the way which connects the footpath mentioned in Para 2P with the footpath\nstated in Para 2H and thereafter they were going to the ramp through the way to 2\n(H).\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_120\">2S.            The ways mentioned in Para 2F, 2H and 2P have been used by the\nmembers of the public and villagers from immemorial times, openly, peacefully,\ncontinuously in order to come to the beach and they are public ways and have been so\ndedicated as is evidenced by the long and continuous user.\n</p><p id=\"p_121\">...............\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_122\">\"3E.       From this parking place a footpath is maintained alongside the Eastern\nboundary of property 787 and Western boundary of property 803 going to the south\nupto the Sea Shore.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_123\">3H.        The Plaintiffs have not come to the Court with clean hands and hence\ndeliberately omitted to represent in the map annexed to the plaint the ramps existing\nin the properties 787 and 803 and giving access to the beach. Similarly the Plaintiffs\nhave deliberately omitted to represent in the map the public way mentioned in Para\n2H and 3E, the Plaintiffs have further deliberately, in order to snatch injunction,\nwrongly represented the way mentioned in 2(k).\"\n</p><p id=\"p_124\">\f                                                                    [Emphasis added]\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_125\">23.       Along with the written statement, appellant No.2 filed affidavit of Shri\n\nAvdhut Kamat, who was engaged as consulting engineer for the hotel project. In\n\nparagraph 2 of his affidavit, Shri Kamat stated as under:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_126\">\n\"2.         I say that under instructions from said Fomento, I have prepared a plan of\nproperty bearing survey No. 787 to 807. The properties with survey No.787, 790, 798,\n800, 801, 802 and 805 have been purchased by said Fomento from Defendants No.2 to\n</p><p id=\"p_127\">5. The plan has been drawn by me taking into consideration the old survey, new\nsurvey and present position on the site. The new numbers of the survey are also\nshown in the plan. On the said plan, I have shown existing public pathways by red\npencil lines. From the said plan it appears that none of the Defendant's lands (all of\nwhich are hatched on the plan) are, in fact, enclosed property, since all of them have\naccess to public ways. The pathways marked red in the plan have been personally\nchecked by me with the assistance of my assistants Engineers and can be verified on\nthe site.\"\n</p><p id=\"p_128\">                                                                    [Emphasis added]\n\n\n\n\n          The affidavit of Shri Kamat was accompanied by the plan marked as\n\nExhibit-A which depicted various pathways including the one going from the beach\n\nto Dona-Paola-Bambolim Road through survey Nos.803 and 792.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_129\">24.       In the reply affidavit filed in Writ Petition No.141/1992, appellant No.1 did\n\nnot dispute the correctness of the written statement filed in Special Civil Suit\n\nNo.313/1978/A or the affidavit of Shri Avdhut Kamat and plan prepared by him after\n\npersonally inspecting the site. The High Court relied on the averments contained in\n\nthe written statement and held that the existence of public access to the\n\nbeach/pathway leading to the beach through survey No.803 cannot be doubted.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_130\">25.       Shri Anil Divan, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants\n\nheavily relied on judgment dated 13.3.2006 passed by Civil Judge, Panaji in Special\n\nCivil Suit No.67/1986 - Alvaro De Souza Machado and another v. Sociedade De\n\fFomento Industrial Pvt. Ltd. and another and argued that the finding recorded by\n\nthe High Court on the issue of existence of public access to the beach through survey\n\nNo.803 should be treated as redundant because the same is entirely based on\n\nadmissions made in the written statement filed on behalf of appellant No.2 in Special\n\nCivil Suit No.313/1978/A and the competent court has found that the same are not\n\nbinding on the appellants (who were defendants in Special Civil Suit No.67/1986). He\n\npointed out that learned Civil Judge, Panaji has found that written statement was not\n\nverified by the concerned person on personal knowledge and, therefore, admissions\n\nmade therein cannot be made basis for recording an adverse finding against the\n\ndefendants in the suit. In the first blush, this argument of the learned senior counsel\n\nappears attractive but on a closure scrutiny, we do not find any merit in it. The\n\nlearned Civil Judge who decided the suit filed by Alvaro De Souza Machado and\n\nanother relied upon the judgments of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1010762/\" id=\"a_101\">Nagubai Ammal &amp; others v. B.\n\nShama Rao &amp; others</a> (supra) and of the Allahabad High Court in <a href=\"/doc/1003986/\" id=\"a_102\">Anurag Misra vs.\n\nRavindra Singh and another</a> (supra) and held that the admissions made in the earlier\n\nsuit in paragraphs 2A, 2C, 2E, 2F to 2S, etc. cannot be treated as binding on the\n\ndefendants because contents of the written statement were verified by using the\n\nwords \"true to the best of my information which I believe as true\" and not on\n\npersonal knowledge. This approach of the learned Civil Judge was clearly contrary\n\nto Order VI Rule 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides for verification\n\nof pleadings. Sub-rule (1) of Rule 15 lays down that save as otherwise provided, by\n\nany law for the time being in force, every pleading shall be verified at the foot by the\n\nparty or by one of parties pleading or by some other person proved to the satisfaction\n\nof the court to be acquainted with the facts of the case. Sub-rule (2) lays down that\n\nthe person verifying shall satisfy, by reference to the numbered paragraphs of the\n\npleadings, what he verifies of his own knowledge and what he verifies upon the\n\ninformation received and believed to be true.         Sub-rule (3) requires that the\n\fverification shall be signed by the person making it and shall state the date on which\n\nand the place at which it was signed. By amending Act No. 46/1999 the requirement\n\nof filing an affidavit by the person verifying the pleadings was incorporated but that\n\nprovision does not have any bearing on this case.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_131\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_132\">26.        The plain language of Order VI Rule 15(2) makes it clear that the\n\npleadings can be verified by the concerned person on his own knowledge or upon the\n\ninformation received and believed to be true by him/her. The written statement filed\n\non behalf of appellant No.2 in Special Civil Suit No.313/1978/A was verified by Smt.\n\nAnju Timblo who represented the appellants cause before various functionaries of\n\nthe State Government and its instrumentalities and also filed reply affidavits in\n\ndifferent writ petitions. Smt. Anju Timblo did not claim that she is acquainted with\n\nthe topography/geography of the area which included survey Nos.792 and 803.\n\nTherefore, she could not have verified the written statement containing the admission\n\nregarding existence of passage/pathway to beach through survey No.803 on her own\n\nknowledge. Therefore, verification of the written statement containing admission\n\nabout the existence of passage through Machado's Cove and survey No.803 on the\n\nbasis of information which she believed to be true was in consonance with Order VI\n\nRule 15(2) and the learned Civil Judge committed an error in holding that the\n\nadmissions contained in the written statement of the earlier suit were not binding on\n\nthe defendants. Another error committed by the learned Civil Judge was that he\n\naltogether overlooked the statement made by Smt. Anju Timblo, who appeared as a\n\nwitness on behalf of the defendants in Special Civil Suit No.67/1986 and candidly\n\naccepted in the cross-examination that the written statement filed in Special Civil\n\nSuit No.313/1978/A contained admissions about existence of access to the beach\n\nthrough survey No.803. It is also significant to note that neither the writ petitioners\n\nnor the State of Goa were parties to the second suit and, therefore, they did not get\n\fopportunity to show that admissions contained in the written statement of appellant\n\nNo.2 in Special Civil Suit No.313/1978/A were rightly relied upon by the High Court\n\nand the learned Civil Judge could not have taken a contrary view.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_133\">27.       It was neither the pleaded case of the appellants before the High Court nor\n\nit was argued on their behalf that the admissions contained in the written statement\n\nfiled in the previous suit about existence of access to the beach from Dona-Paola-\n\nBambolim Road through survey Nos.792 (Machado's Cove) and 803 were made\n\nunder a bonafide mistake and the affidavit of Shri Avdhut Kamat and the sketch\n\nprepared by him were contrary to the actual physical status of various survey\n\nnumbers mentioned therein. Therefore, the High Court cannot be said to have erred\n\nin relying upon the admissions made in the written statement of appellant No.2 in\n\nSpecial Civil Suit No. 313/1978/A that there existed access to the beach through\n\nsurvey Nos.792 and 803 before its acquisition by the State Government.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_134\">28.       The propositions of law laid down in Nagubai Ammal's case and\n\nNusserwanji Rattanji Mistri's case on which reliance has been placed by Shri Divan\n\ndo not have any bearing on the cases in hand. In Nagubai Ammal's case, this Court\n\nconsidered the legality of the sale made in execution of decree passed on a mortgage\n\ndeed. The appellants, who were defendants in the suit for declaration of title to\n\ncertain building sites, resisted the respondents' claim based on the purchase made in\n\nexecution of mortgage decree. That suit was decreed in 1921 and the lands were\n\npurchased by the decree holder in 1928. The mortgager was adjudged an insolvent in\n\n1926. Suit to enforce the mortgage deed was brought in 1933 impleading the official\n\nreceiver and the purchaser in execution of the maintenance and charge decree, but\n\nthe appellants were not impleaded as parties. In execution of the decree passed in the\n\nsecond suit, the lands were sold to a third party. The respondents' father purchased\n\nthe land in 1938 from the said third party. The learned District Judge held that the\n\fappellants' title acquired by the purchase of 1920 stood extinguished by the sale held\n\nin execution of the charge decree by operation of <a href=\"/doc/1634925/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 52</a> of the Transfer of\n\nProperty Act. Before the Supreme Court, the appellants relied on the admission\n\nmade by Abdul Huq (predecessors of respondents), and the respondents themselves\n\nthat the decree and sale in the suit instituted in 1920 were collusive. While rejecting\n\nthe argument, this Court observed:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_135\">\n\"An admission is not conclusive as to the truth of the matters stated therein. It is only\na piece of evidence, the weight to be attached to which must depend on the\ncircumstances under which it is made. It can be shown to be erroneous or untrue, so\nlong as the person to whom it was made has not acted upon it to his detriment, when\nit might become conclusive by way of estoppel. In the present case, there is no\nquestion of estoppel, as the title of Dr. Nanjunda Rao arose under a purchase which\nwas longer prior to the admissions made in 1932 and in the subsequent years. It is\nargued for the appellants that these admissions at the least shifted the burden on to\nthe plaintiff of proving that the proceedings were not collusive, and that as he gave no\nevidence worth the name that these statements were made under a mistake or for a\npurpose and were, in fact, not true, full effect must be given to them. Reliance was\nplaced on the well-known observations of Baron Park in Slatterie v. Pooley [[1840] 6\nM. &amp; W. 664, 669; 151 E.R. 579, 581], that \"what a party himself admits to be true\nmay reasonably be presumed to be so\", and on the decision in <a href=\"/doc/99435/\" id=\"a_104\">Rani Chandra Kunwar\nv. Chaudhri Narpat Singh</a> : <a href=\"/doc/99435/\" id=\"a_105\">Rani Chandra Kunwar v. Rajah Makund Singh</a> [[1906-\n07] L.R. 34 I.A. 27], where this statement of the law was adopted. No exception can be\ntaken to this proposition. But before it can be invoked, it must be shown that there is\na clear and unambiguous statement by the opponent, such as will be conclusive unless\nexplained. It has been a already pointed out that the tenor of the statements made by\nAbdul Huq, his legal representatives and the plaintiff was to suggest that the\nproceedings in O. S. No. 100 of 1919-20 were fraudulent and not collusive in\ncharacter. Those statements would not, in our opinion, be sufficient, without more, to\nsustain a finding that the proceedings were collusive.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_136\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_137\">           In Anurag Misra's case (supra), the learned Single Judge of the Allahabad\n\nHigh Court held that vague allegations about the ownership of the premises made by\n\nthe tenant in his written statement filed in a suit for eviction cannot be treated as\n\nadmission about the contract of tenancy with the plaintiff/landlord and the tenant\n\ncannot be estopped from subsequently disputing the relationship of landlord and\n\ntenant by pleading that somebody else is the owner of the premises in question.\n</p><p id=\"p_138\">\f29.        In neither of the afore-mentioned cases, this Court or Allahabad High\n\nCourt considered whether unequivocal admission made by a party in a\n\ncontemporaneous litigation can be ignored on the ground of so-called defect in\n\nverification.   That apart, as we have already found, verification of the written\n\nstatement filed on behalf of appellant No.2 in Special Civil Suit No. 313/1978/A was in\n\nconformity with Order VI Rule 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the High Court\n\nrightly relied upon the same for holding that existence of public access to the beach\n\nthrough survey No.803 (new No.246/2) cannot be doubted.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_139\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_140\">30.        The appellants attempt to confuse the existence of access to the beach from\n\npoint `A' to `B' in survey No.803 with the so-called access running along side nallah\n\ndeserves to be discarded because no such case was projected before the High Court\n\nand no argument was advanced on that score. It is also worth mentioning that in his\n\nletter dated 1.12.1978 the Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat had made a specific\n\nmention of public footpath which runs on survey No.787 and forms the boundary of\n\nsurvey No.803 and the parking area which was shown as situated on the Northeast\n\ncorner of survey No.787 adjacent to survey No.803.     There is no mention in any of\n\nthe documents of the so-called access along side the nallah dividing survey No.803\n\n(new No.246/2) on the one hand and survey Nos.804 and 805 on the other hand.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_141\">31.        Once it is held that there existed public access to the beach through survey\n\nNo.803 (new No.246/2) before its acquisition by the State Government in 1980, the\n\nappellants are duty bound to act in accordance with Clause 4(ix) of the agreement,\n\nwhich has the force of law by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 42</a> of the 1894 Act. That clause casts a\n\nduty on appellant No.1 to maintain access to the beach without obstruction of any\n\nkind whatsoever. The argument of Shri Anil Divan and Shri Pallav Shishodia,\n\nlearned senior counsel appearing for the appellants and the State of Goa respectively,\n\fthat the Court may relieve the appellants of the obligation to maintain access to the\n\nbeach through survey No.803 (new No.246/2) because an alternative access has been\n\nprovided by constructing road, parking area and public footpath, in furtherance of\n\nthe permission accorded by the Gram Panchayat for construction of hotel in survey\n\nNo. 787, cannot be accepted for the simple reason that the agreement was executed\n\nbetween the President of India and appellant No.1 in the backdrop of acquisition of\n\nsurvey No.803 (new No.246/2) and 804 (new No.245/2) and survey No.787 on which\n\nthe hotel was constructed has nothing to do with the acquisition proceedings.\n\nTherefore, the alternative road, parking and public footpath provided by appellant\n\nNo.1 in lieu of the access available through survey No.787 cannot be made basis for\n\ndepriving members of the public of their age old right to go to the beach through\n\nsurvey No.803 (new No. 246/2).\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_142\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_143\">32.       The matter deserves to be considered from another angle. The public\n\ntrust doctrine which has been invoked by Ms. Indira Jaising in support of her\n\nargument that the beach in question is a public beach and the appellants cannot\n\nprivatize the same by blocking/obstructing traditional access available through\n\nsurvey No.803 (new No.246/2) is implicitly engrafted by the State Government in\n\nClause 4(ix) of the agreement. That doctrine primarily rests on the principle that\n\ncertain resources like air, sea, waters and the forests have such a great importance to\n\nthe people as a whole that it would be wholly unjustified to make them a subject of\n\nprivate ownership. These resources are gift of nature, therefore, they should be\n\nfreely available to everyone irrespective of one's status in life. The public trust\n\ndoctrine enjoins upon the Government to protect the resources for the enjoyment of\n\nthe general public rather than to permit their use for private ownership or\n\ncommercial purposes. This doctrine puts an implicit embargo on the right of the\n\nState to transfer public properties to private party if such transfer affects public\n\finterest, mandates affirmative State action for effective management of natural\n\nresources and empowers the citizens to question ineffective management thereof. The\n\nheart of the public trust doctrine is that it imposes limits and obligations upon\n\ngovernment agencies and their administrators on behalf of all the people and\n\nespecially future generations. For example, renewable and non-renewable resources,\n\nassociated uses, ecological values or objects in which the public has a special interest\n\n(i.e. public lands, waters, etc.) are held subject to the duty of the State not to impair\n\nsuch resources, uses or values, even if private interests are involved. The same\n\nobligations apply to managers of forests, monuments, parks, the public domain and\n\nother public assets. Professor Joseph L. Sax in his classic article \"The Public Trust\n\nDoctrine in     Natural Resources Law: Effective Judicial Intervention\" (1970),\n\nindicates that the Public Trust Doctrine, of all concepts known to law, constitutes the\n\nbest practical and philosophical premise and legal tool for protecting public rights\n\nand for protecting and managing resources, ecological values or objects held in trust.\n\nThe Public Trust Doctrine is a tool for exerting long-established public rights over\n\nshort-term public rights and private gain. Today, every person exercising his or her\n\nright to use the air, water, or land and associated natural ecosystems has the\n\nobligation to secure for the rest of us the right to live or otherwise use that same\n\nresource or property for the long term and enjoyment by future generations. To say\n\nit another way, a landowner or lessee and a water right holder has an obligation to\n\nuse such resources in a manner as not to impair or diminish the people's rights and\n\nthe people's long term interest in that property or resource, including down-slope\n\nlands, waters and resources.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_144\">\n</p><p id=\"p_145\">33.        In Illinois Central Railraod Co. vs. People of the State of Illinois [146 US\n\n387], the United States Supreme Court considered whether the State could abdicate\n\nits general control over the sub-merged land. In the year 1869, the Illonois legislature\n\nmade a substantial grant of sub-merged land - a mile strip along the shores of Lake\n\fMichigan extending one mile out from the shoreline - to the Illinois Central Railroad.\n\nThis was repealed in 1869. The State of Illinois sued to quit title. The Supreme\n\nCourt while accepting the stand of the State of Illinois held that the title of the State\n\nin the land in dispute was a title different in character from that which the State held\n\nin lands intended for sale. It was different from the title which the United States held\n\nin public lands which were open to pre-emption and sale. It was a title held in trust\n\n</p><p id=\"p_146\">-- for the people of the State that they may enjoy the navigation of the water, carry\n\non commerce over them and have liberty of fishing therein free from obstruction or\n\ninterference of private parties. The abdication of the general control of the State over\n\nlands in dispute was not consistent with the exercise of the trust which required the\n\nGovernment of the State to preserve such waters for the use of the public.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_147\">34.        In Robbins vs. Deptt. of Public Works [244 NE 2d 577], the Supreme\n\nJudicial Court of Massachusetts restrained the Public Works Department from\n\nacquiring Fowl Meadows, \"wetlands of considerable natural beauty ... often used for\n\nnature study and recreation\" for highway use.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_148\">\n</p><p id=\"p_149\">35.        In National Audubon Society vs. Superior Court of Alpine County [33 Cal\n\n3d 419], the Supreme Court of California considered whether a permit can be\n\ngranted to the Department of Water and Power of the City of Los Angeles to\n\nappropriate water of four of the five streams flowing into Mono Lake, which is the\n\nsecond largest lake in California. Some environmentalists, using the public trust\n\ndoctrine, brought law suit against Los Angeles Water Diversions. The Supreme\n\nCourt of California explained the concept of public trust doctrine in the following\n\nwords:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_150\">\n\" `By the law of nature these things are common to mankind -- the air, running\nwater, the sea and consequently the shores of the sea.' (Institutes of Justinian 2.1.1)\nFrom this origin in Roman law, the English common law evolved the concept of the\npublic trust, under which the sovereign owns `all of its navigable waterways and the\n\flands lying beneath them as trustee of a public trust for the benefit of the people.' \"\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_151\">           While dealing with the State's power as a trustee of public property, the\n\nCourt observed:-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_152\">\"Thus, the public trust is more than an affirmation of State power to use public\nproperty for public purposes. It is an affirmation of the duty of the State to protect\nthe people's common heritage of streams, lakes, marshlands and tidelands,\nsurrendering that right of protection only in rare cases when the abandonment of\nthat right is consistent with the purposes of the trust....\"\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_153\">           The Court recorded its conclusion in the following words:-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_154\">\"The State has an affirmative duty to take the public trust into account in the\nplanning and allocation of water resources, and to protect public trust uses whenever\nfeasible. Just as the history of this State shows that appropriation may be necessary\nfor efficient use of water despite unavoidable harm to public trust values, it\ndemonstrates that an appropriative water rights system administered without\nconsideration of the public trust may cause unnecessary and unjustified harm to trust\ninterests. (See Johnson, 14 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 233, 256-57/; Robie, Some Reflections\non Environmental Considerations in Water Rights Administration, 2 Ecology L.Q. 695,\n710-711 (1972); Comment, 33 Hastings L.J. 653, 654.) As a matter of practical\nnecessity the State may have to approve appropriations despite foreseeable harm to\npublic trust uses. In so doing, however, the State must bear in mind its duty as trustee\nto consider the effect of the taking on the public trust (see United Plainsmen v. N.D.\nState Water Cons. Comm'n [247 NW 2d 457 (ND 1976)] at pp.462-463, and to\npreserve, so far as consistent with the public interest, the uses protected by the trust.\"\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_155\">36.        The Indian society has, since time immemorial, been conscious of the\n\nnecessity of protecting environment and ecology. The main moto of social life has\n\nbeen \"to live in harmony with nature\". Sages and Saints of India lived in forests.\n\nTheir preachings contained in Vedas, Upanishadas, Smritis etc. are ample evidence of\n\nthe society's respect for plants, trees, earth, sky, air, water and every form of life. It\n\nwas regarded as a sacred duty of every one to protect them. In those days, people\n\nworshipped trees, rivers and sea which were treated as belonging to all living\n\ncreatures. The children were educated by their parents and grandparents about the\n\fnecessity of keeping the environment clean and protecting earth, rivers, sea, forests,\n\ntrees, flora fauna and every species of life.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_156\">\n\nThe Constitution of India, which was enforced on 26th January, 1950 did not contain\n\nany provision obligating the State to protect environment and ecology, but the people\n\ncontinued to treat it as their social duty to respect the nature, natural resources and\n\nprotect environment and ecology. After almost three decades of independence, the\n\nlegislature recognized the importance of protecting and improving environment and\n\nsafeguarding forests and wild life and <a href=\"/doc/871328/\" id=\"a_107\">Article 48A</a> was inserted in Part IV of the\n\nConstitution by the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 whereby a\n\nduty was imposed on the State to endeavour to protect and improve the environment\n\nand safeguard forests and wild life of the country. By the same amendment <a href=\"/doc/867010/\" id=\"a_108\">Article\n\n51A</a> was inserted in the form of Part IVA which enumerates fundamental duties of\n\nevery citizen. <a href=\"/doc/1644544/\" id=\"a_109\">Article 51A(g)</a> declares that it shall be the duty of every citizen of India\n\nto protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and\n\nwild life and to have compassion for living creatures.          Thereafter, the Courts\n\nrepeatedly invoked Articles 48A and 51A for protecting environment and ecology and\n\nseveral orders were passed in public interest litigation mandating the State to take\n\naction for protecting forests, rivers and anti pollution measures.\n\n\n\nThe importance of the public trust doctrine was also recognized by this Court and the\n\nsame was applied for protecting natural resources which have been treated as public\n\nproperties and are held by the government as trustee of the people. <a href=\"/doc/1514672/\" id=\"a_110\">In M.C. Mehta v.\n\nKamal Nath and others</a> [(1997) 1 SCC 388], this Court considered whether a private\n\ncompany running tourists resort in Kullu-Manali valley could block the flow of Beas\n\nriver and create a new channel to divert the river to at least 1 kilometer down stream.\n\fAfter adverting to the theoretical and philosophical basis of the public trust doctrine\n\nand some judgments on the subject, this Court observed:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_157\">\n\"We are fully aware that the issues presented in this case illustrate the classic\nstruggle between those members of the public who would preserve our rivers, forests,\nparks and open lands in their pristine purity and those charged with administrative\nresponsibilities who, under the pressures of the changing needs of an increasingly\ncomplex society, find it necessary to encroach to some extent upon open lands\nheretofore considered inviolate to change. The resolution of this conflict in any given\ncase is for the legislature and not the courts. If there is a law made by Parliament or\nthe State Legislatures the courts can serve as an instrument of determining legislative\nintent in the exercise of its powers of judicial review under the Constitution. But in\nthe absence of any legislation, the executive acting under the doctrine of public trust\ncannot abdicate the natural resources and convert them into private ownership, or\nfor commercial use. The aesthetic use and the pristine glory of the natural resources,\nthe environment and the ecosystems of our country cannot be permitted to be eroded\nfor private, commercial or any other use unless the courts find it necessary, in good\nfaith, for the public good and in public interest to encroach upon the said resources.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_158\">37.        <a href=\"/doc/1937304/\" id=\"a_111\">In M.I.

Radhey Shyam Sahu and others</a> [(1999) 6\n\nSCC 464], the Court applied public trust doctrine for upholding the order of\n\nAllahabad High Court which quashed the decision of Lucknow Nagar Mahapalika\n\npermitting appellant - M.I. Builders Pvt. Ltd. to construct an underground shopping\n\ncomplex in Jhandewala Park, Aminabad Market, Lucknow, and directed demolition\n\nof the construction made on the park land. The High Court noted that Lucknow\n\nNagar Mahapalika had entered into an agreement with the appellant for construction\n\nof shopping complex and given it full freedom to lease out the shops and also to sign\n\nagreement on its behalf and held that this was impermissible. On appeal by the\n\nbuilders, this Court held that the terms of agreement were unreasonable, unfair and\n\natrocious. The Court then invoked the public trust doctrine and held that being a\n\ntrustee of the park on behalf of the public, the Nagar Mahapalika could not have\n\ntransferred the same to the private builder and thereby deprived the residents of the\n\narea of the quality of life to which they were entitled under the Constitution and\n\nMunicipal Laws.\n</p><p id=\"p_159\">\f38.        <a href=\"/doc/1867873/\" id=\"a_112\">In Intellectuals Forum, Tirupathi vs. State of A.P. and others</a> [(2006) 3\n\nSCC 549], this Court again invoked the public trust doctrine in a matter involving\n\nthe challenge to the systematic destruction of percolation, irrigation and drinking\n\nwater tanks in Tirupati town, referred to some judicial precedents including <a href=\"/doc/1514672/\" id=\"a_113\">M.C.\n\nMehta vs. Kamal Nath</a> (supra), M.I. Builders Pvt. Ltd. (supra), National Audubon\n\nSociety (supra), and observed:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_160\">\n\"This is an articulation of the doctrine from the angle of the affirmative duties of the\nState with regard to public trust. Formulated from a negatory angle, the doctrine\ndoes not exactly prohibit the alienation of the property held as a public trust.\nHowever, when the State holds a resource that is freely available for the use of the\npublic, it provides for a high degree of judicial scrutiny on any action of the\nGovernment, no matter how consistent with the existing legislations, that attempts to\nrestrict such free use. To properly scrutinise such actions of the Government, the\ncourts must make a distinction between the Government's general obligation to act\nfor the public benefit, and the special, more demanding obligation which it may have\nas a trustee of certain public resources [Joseph L. Sax \"The Public Trust Doctrine in\nNatural Resource Law: Effective Judicial Intervention\", Michigan Law Review, Vol.\n68, No. 3 (Jan. 1970) pp.471-566]. According to Prof. Sax, whose article on this\nsubject is considered to be an authority, three types of restrictions on governmental\nauthority are often thought to be imposed by the public trust doctrine [ibid]:\n</p><p id=\"p_161\">1.        the property subject to the trust must not only be used for a public\npurpose, but it must be held available for use by the general public;\n</p><p id=\"p_162\">2.         the property may not be sold, even for fair cash equivalent;\n</p><p id=\"p_163\">3.         the property must be maintained for particular types of use (i) either\ntraditional uses, or (ii) some uses particular to that form of resources.\"\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_164\">39.        The Court then held that the government orders are violative of principle\n\nNos.1 to 3, mentioned in the article of Professor Joseph L. Sax and directed that no\n\nfurther construction be made in Peruru and Avilala tanks and corrective measures be\n\ntaken for recharging them.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_165\">\n</p><p id=\"p_166\">40.        We reiterate that natural resources including forests, water bodies, rivers,\n\nsea shores, etc. are held by the State as a trustee on behalf of the people and\n\nespecially the future generations. These constitute common properties and people are\n\nentitled to uninterrupted use thereof.       The State cannot transfer public trust\n\nproperties to a private party, if such a transfer interferes with the right of the public\n\fand the Court can invoke the public trust doctrine and take affirmative action for\n\nprotecting the right of people to have access to light, air and water and also for\n\nprotecting rivers, sea, tanks, trees, forests and associated natural eco-systems.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_167\">41.        As a sequel to the above discussion, we hold that Clause 4(ix) of the\n\nagreement is binding on the appellants and appellant No.1 is under a statutory\n\nobligation to maintain access/road to the beach through survey No.803 (new\n\nNo.246/2) without any obstruction of any kind and the High Court did not commit\n\nany error by issuing a mandamus in that regard.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_168\">\n\nRe:3\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_169\">42.        <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 16</a> of the 1894 Act which constitute the foundation of the\n\narguments of the appellants and State that the public access to the beach, if any\n\navailable, through survey No.803 (new No.246/2) stood extinguished with the vesting\n\nof land in the State Government, reads as under:-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_170\">\n\n\"16. Power to take possession. - When the Collector has made an award under\n<a href=\"/doc/236032/\" id=\"a_115\">Section 11</a>, he may take possession of the land, which shall thereupon vest absolutely\nin the Government, free from all encumbrances.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_171\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_172\">43.        The argument of Shri Anil Divan, learned senior counsel appearing for the\n\nappellants is that even though access to the beach may have been available through\n\nsurvey No.803 before its acquisition and the general public may have been using the\n\nsame as of right for going to the beach, the said right got terminated as soon as\n\npossession of the land was taken by the government. His further argument is that\n\npublic access to the beach through survey No.803 was in the nature of encumbrance\n\fon the land which stood extinguished on vesting of the land in the Government in\n\nterms of <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_116\">Section 16</a> of the 1894 Act. Shri Pallav Shishodia, learned senior counsel\n\nappearing for the State adopted this argument and emphatically submitted that\n\naccess to the beach available to the public through survey No.803 (new No.246/2)\n\nbefore its acquisition was obliterated once the acquired land vested in the\n\nGovernment.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_173\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_174\">44.        Although, no exception can be taken to the appellants coming forward\n\nwith such an argument despite the fact that in terms of Clause 4(ix) of the agreement\n\nwhich has, by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_117\">Section 42</a> of the 1894 Act, the force of law, they are required\n\nto maintain public access to the beach, we are quite surprised with the stance adopted\n\nby the State Government. Admittedly, the agreement was executed by appellant No.1\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_118\">Section 41</a> of the 1894 Act in the backdrop of acquisition of survey No.803\n\n(new No.246/2) and survey No.804 (new No.245/2). It is also not in dispute that in\n\nterms of Clause 4(ix), appellant No.1 is required to maintain access to the beach\n\nwithout any obstruction. This shows that despite <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_119\">Section 16</a> of the 1894 Act, the\n\nparties had consciously decided to protect the traditional right of the members of\n\npublic to go to the beach by using the existing pathway through the acquired land.\n\nBoth, the appellants and State functionaries knew that there exist public access to the\n\nbeach through survey No.803 (new No.246/2), that members of public were using the\n\nsame since time immemorial and that it was necessary to protect that right.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to find any fault with the view taken by the High Court\n\nthat access to the beach is not an encumbrance and in any case, the traditional\n\npathway available to the public for going to the beach through survey No.803 (new\n\nNo.246/2) cannot be treated as having been extinguished in the face of specific\n\nprovision contained in the agreement which is statutory in character.\n</p><p id=\"p_175\">\f45.        <a href=\"/doc/1214175/\" id=\"a_120\">In Collector of Bombay vs. Nusserwanji Rattanji Mistri</a> [AIR 1955 SC\n\n298], a bench of three Judges considered whether right of the State to levy assessment\n\non the land can be treated to have been extinguished in view of <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_121\">Section 16</a> of the 1894\n\nAct. The Court answered the question in negative and observed:-\n\n\n\n\"Under <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 16</a>, when the Collector makes an award `he may take possession of\nthe land which shall thereupon vest absolutely in the Government free from all\nencumbrances'. The word `encumbrances' in this section can only mean interests in\nrespect of which a compensation was made under <a href=\"/doc/236032/\" id=\"a_123\">Section 11</a>, or could have been\nclaimed. It cannot include the right of the government to levy assessment on the\nland\".\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_176\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_177\">46.        <a href=\"/doc/1892742/\" id=\"a_124\">In State of H.P. vs. Tarsem Singh</a> [(2001) 8 SCC 104], a two-Judge bench\n\ninterpreted Section 3 of H.P. Village Common Lands Vesting and Utilization Act,\n\n1973 and held that the common right of grazing available to the people of the area\n\nstood extinguished with the vesting of land in the State. The respondents who were\n\nresidents of the village brought a suit in representative capacity for declaration that\n\nthe land in dispute is being used for grazing cattle, cutting fuel wood and for other\n\ncommon purposes and the defendant cannot interfere with their easementary right to\n\nenjoy the land. The trial Court decreed the suit. The appeal preferred by the state\n\nwas substantially dismissed by the first appellate Court. The High Court dismissed\n\nthe second appeal and held that easementary right of grazing cannot be treated to\n\nhave vested in the State under <a href=\"/doc/82904/\" id=\"a_125\">Section 3</a>. This Court reversed the judgment of the\n\nHigh Court and dismissed the suit. After noticing the non obstante clause used in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/767093/\" id=\"a_126\">Section 3(1)</a> of the Act, the Court held that all interests, title and rights in the land\n\nvested in the Gram Panchayat stood extinguished and came to be vested in the State\n\nfree from all encumbrances including the easementary right. In the course of the\n\njudgment, two-Judges bench referred to the judgments of Allahabad and Calcutta\n\fHigh Courts wherein it was held that the word `encumbrance' means burden or\n\ncharge upon property for a claim or lien upon State or land and it would include\n\neasementary right over the land.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_178\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_179\">47.       The last mentioned judgment was considered by another bench of two-\n\nJudges in <a href=\"/doc/1695760/\" id=\"a_127\">H.P. State Electricity Board and others vs. Shiv K. Sharma and others</a>\n\n[(2005) 2 SCC 164]. The facts of that case were that appellant-board purchased\n\n10.10. bighas out of the holding of one Rikhi Ram.        The sale deed specifically\n\nmentioned that respondent Nos.1 to 3 shall have access to their land from the land of\n\nthe seller. Thereafter, the State Government acquired an area of 41.06 bighas of land\n\nfor construction of 60 KW Sub-Station. The acquired land included the remaining\n\nland of Rikhi Ram from whom respondent Nos.1 to 3 had purchased the land. After\n\nacquisition, the entire property was fenced of by barbed wire and electric sub-station\n\nand living quarters of the employees of appellant were also constructed thereupon.\n\nIn the process, the appellant blocked off the passage being used as access to the land\n\nof the respondents. Respondent Nos.1 to 3 unsuccessfully sued the appellant-board\n\nfor mandatory injunction to remove the barbed wire fence blocking access to their\n\nland. On appeal, the learned District Judge reversed the judgment of the trial Court\n\nand decreed the suit. The High Court confirmed the appellate judgment. Before this\n\nCourt, reliance was placed on the judgment in Tarsem Singh's case and it was argued\n\nthat even if respondent Nos.1 to 3 had a right of way by easement over the land of\n\nRikhi Ram, the said land having been acquired stood vested in the State Government\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_128\">Section 16</a> absolutely free from all encumbrances including such easementary\n\nright. The High Court drew a distinction between easement of an ordinary nature in\n\nrespect of which compensation could have been claimed in the land acquisition\n\nproceedings and an easement of necessity like a right of passage and held that such\n\nright was not extinguished by reason of acquisition. For this purpose, the High Court\n\frelied on the observations made in Nusserwanji Rattanji Mistri's case.            While\n\nconfirming the High Court's verdict, the two-Judges bench observed:\n\n\n\"This judgment of Collector of Bombay was a judgment by a Bench of three learned\nJudges of this Court. Learned counsel for the appellants drew our attention to the\njudgment in State of H.P. rendered by a Bench of two learned Judges and contended\nthat this judgment clearly holds that the phrase \"free from all encumbrances\" used in\n<a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_129\">Section 16</a> of the Act is wholly unqualified and would include in its compass every\nright including an easementary right which affects the land. He particularly drew our\nattention to para 10 of the judgment where the Court took the view:\n\"All rights, title and interests including the easementary rights stood extinguished\nand all such rights, title and interests vested in the State free from all encumbrances.\"\nIn the first place, it is difficult for us to read the judgment in Tarsem Singh case as\ntaking a view contrary to and differing from the law laid down by a larger Bench in\nCollector of Bombay. Secondly, we notice that the decision in Tarsem Singh is not in\nrespect of an easementary right arising out of necessity. There does not seem to be\nany discussion on the said aspect of the matter in this judgment. The view taken in\nCollector of Bombay therefore, appears to hold the field, particularly where the\nnature of easementary right claimed is not capable of being evaluated in terms of\ncompensation and arises out of sheer necessity.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_180\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_181\">48.        By applying the ratio of the judgments in Nusserwanji Rattanji Mistri's\n\ncase and H.P. State Electricity Board's case to the facts of this case, we hold that\n\nwhen the State volunteered to take possession of the land subject to the right of the\n\nmembers of public to access the beach through the acquired land and a specific\n\nprovision to that effect was incorporated in the agreement executed under <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_130\">Section 41</a>\n\n(5), <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_131\">Section 16</a> of the 1894 Act cannot be invoked for nullifying the right of the public\n\nto access the beach through survey No.803 (new No.246/2).\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_182\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_183\">49.        We also do not find any substance in the argument of Shri Anil Divan that\n\nCourt should not insist on continuance of public access to the beach through survey\n\nNo.803 (new No.246/2) because the pathway going to Dona Paula-Bambolim Road\n\nwhich was available through survey No.792 (new No.242/1) (Machado's Cove) does\n\nnot exist any more. The premise on which Shri Divan has made this argument,\n\nnamely, non-availability of pathway through survey No.792 does not find support\n\ffrom the record of these appeals. Therefore, it is neither proper nor justified for this\n\nCourt to deny the people of their traditional right of access to the beach through\n\nsurvey No.803 (new No.246/2) which goes to Dona-Paola-Bambolim Road by using\n\nthe roads provided in survey No.792 (new No.242/1) (Machado's Cove).\n\n\n\nRe: 4\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_184\">50.        For deciding this question, we shall have to again advert to the factual\n\nmatrix of the case. Appellant No.2 purchased survey Nos.787 and 805 from Dr.\n\nAlvaro Remiojo Binto and leased out the same to appellant No.1. The latter obtained\n\npermission from the Gram Panchayat for constructing hotel building in survey\n\nNo.787. The construction commenced in 1978 and was completed in May 1983.\n\nAlongside construction of the hotel building, appellant No.1 approached the State\n\nGovernment for acquisition of land in various survey numbers including survey\n\nNos.803 and 804 (new Nos.246/2 and 245/2). In paragraph 3 of the application\n\naddressed to Shri Shankar Laad, Minister of Revenue, Government of Goa, appellant\n\nNo.1 gave out that in the first phase of the project hotel building was proposed to be\n\nconstructed in survey No. 787 and in the second phase, yoga centre, health club and\n\nwater sports facilities were proposed to be put up in survey No.805 for promoting\n\ntourism.   In paragraph 5, appellant No.1 offered justification for acquisition of\n\nsurvey Nos.788 and 789 which abut the beach. In paragraph 6, appellant No.1\n\npointed out that for second phase of the hotel complex, it would be desirable to\n\nacquire survey Nos.803 and 804 which will make the entire area one composite unit.\n\nIt is thus evident that at the time of making application to the State Government for\n\nacquisition of land, appellant No.1 did not have any proposal for construction and/or\n\nextension of hotel building in survey No.803. The State Government initiated\n\nacquisition proceedings by issuing notification dated 29.10.1980 under <a href=\"/doc/875938/\" id=\"a_132\">Section 4(1)</a> of\n\f1894 Act, which were finalized in 1983. After Government took possession of the\n\nacquired land, appellant No.1 entered into an agreement as per the requirement of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_133\">Section 41</a>. Clauses 3, 4 (ii), (iv), (v) and (vii) of the agreement enumerate affirmative\n\nactions required to be taken by appellant No.1 for achieving the object of acquisition,\n\nwhereas Clause 4(i), (vi), (viii) and (ix) contain various negative covenants including\n\nthe one against the use of land for any purpose other than for which it was acquired.\n\nA conjoint reading of these clauses unmistakably shows that appellant No.1 was to\n\nuse the acquired land only in furtherance of and for the purpose for which it was\n\nacquired, namely, creation of sports and other recreational facilities/amenities and to\n\nmaintain the same in good order and condition and was not to use the land for any\n\nother purpose. The first part of Clause 4(viii) contains an express embargo against\n\nconstruction of any building or structure on the acquired land by appellant No.1.\n\nThe second part of that clause envisages that prior approval of EDC of the\n\nGovernment of Goa will be obtained before undertaking activities for its\n\ndevelopment, besides other statutory requirements under the existing laws. The\n\nmanagement of appellant No.1 was very much aware of the embargo contained in\n\nfirst part of Clause 4(viii) against construction of any building or structure on the\n\nacquired land and this is the reason why in the application made by Smt. Anju\n\nTimblo to the Development Authority under <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_134\">Section 44(1)</a> read with Section 49 of\n\nTown and Country Planning Act for grant of permission for extension of the existing\n\nhotel building, survey No.246/2 was not mentioned. The EEC and EDC considered\n\nthat application and approved extension of the existing hotel building on land in\n\nsurvey Nos.246/1, 246/3 and 246/4 (old Nos.787, 788 and 789) subject, of course, to the\n\ncondition of maintaining pedestrian path. The order issued by the Development\n\nAuthority on 15.4.1988 was also for extension of the existing hotel building on land\n\nbearing survey No.246/1, 3 and 4. Neither in the minutes of EEC or EDC nor in the\n\norder issued by the Development Authority under <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_135\">Section 44(3)(c)</a> read with Section\n\f49(2) of the Town and Country Planning Act, there was any mention of survey\n\nNo.246/2. This shows that till that stage, appellant No.1 had consciously refrained\n\nfrom putting up even a proposal for constructing any building or structure on the\n\nacquired land. For the first time a request to that effect was made in the garb of\n\nmaking an application for renewal of permission granted by order dated 15.4.1988\n\nwith a deviation. A mention of four sub-divisions of survey No. 246 (1, 2, 3 and 4)\n\nwas made instead of three sub-divisions, i.e., 1, 3 and 4. With a view to avoid scrutiny\n\nby the EEC and EDC, the appellants managed consideration of the application for\n\nextension and deviation of hotel building by the Board constituted under Section 4 of\n\nthe Town and Country Planning Act.            The Board considered and approved\n\nextension/deviation albeit in violation of the negative covenant contained in first part\n\nof Clause 4(viii) of the statutory agreement. While doing that, the Board was fully\n\ncognizant of the fact that in view of Clause 4 (viii), appellant No.1 cannot use the land\n\nfor constructing any structure and also that even for undertaking any activity\n\nrelating to development, approval of the EDC will be necessary. That is why the\n\nState Government forwarded the decision of the Board to the Development Authority\n\nfor its consideration.    Unfortunately, the Development Authority without even\n\nbringing the matter to the notice of the EDC, passed order dated 20.4.1992 and\n\npermitted appellant No.1 to carry out construction on plot bearing survey No.246/2.\n\nIn our considered view, neither the State Government nor the Board could allow\n\nextension of the hotel building on the acquired land in violation of first part of Clause\n\n4(viii) of agreement dated 26.10.1983 which, at the cost of repetition, we would like to\n\nemphasise, has the force of law by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_136\">Section 42</a> of the 1894 Act. Section 8 of\n\nthe Town and Country Planning Act, which enumerates functions and powers of the\n\nBoard reads as under:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_185\">\n\n\"8. Functions and powers of Board.--(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act and the\nrules made thereunder, the functions of the Board shall be to guide, direct and assist\n\fthe Planning and Development Authorities, to advise the Government in matters\nrelating to the planning, development and use of rural and urban land in the Union\nTerritory, and to perform such other functions as the Government may, from time to\ntime, assign to the Board.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_186\">\n(2) In particular, and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provisions,\nthe Board may, and shall if required by the Government so to do--\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_187\">(a)      direct the preparation of development plans by the Planning and\nDevelopment Authorities;\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_188\">\n</p><p id=\"p_189\">(b)        undertake, assist and encourage the collection, maintenance and\npublication of statistics, bulletins and monographs on planning and its methodology;\n\n\n(c )     co-ordinate and advise on the planning and implementation of physical\ndevelopment programmes within the Union Territory;\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_190\">\n</p><p id=\"p_191\">(d)        prepare and furnish reports relating to the working of this Act; and\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_192\">(e)       perform such other functions as are incidental, supplemental or\nconsequential to any of the functions aforesaid or which may be prescribed.\n\n\n(3) The Board may exercise all such powers as may be necessary or expedient for the\npurpose of carrying out its functions under this Act.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_193\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_194\">51.        A reading of the above reproduced section makes it clear that the Board is\n\nrequired to guide, direct and assist the Planning and Development Authorities; to\n\nadvise the Government in matters relating to the planning, development and use of\n\nrural and urban land in the Union Territory, and to perform other functions\n\nassigned to it by the Government. In terms of <a href=\"/doc/919464/\" id=\"a_137\">Section 8(2)</a>, the Board can direct the\n\npreparation of development plans by the Planning and Development Authorities;\n\nundertake, assist and encourage the collection, maintenance and publication of\n\nstatistics, bulletins and monographs on planning and its methodology; co-ordinate\n\nand advise on the planning and implementation of physical development programmes\n\fand perform such other functions which are incidental to the enumerated functions.\n\nThe role of the State Government primarily relates to approval of regional plan\n\n(S.44), revision of regional plan (S.17), declaration of planning areas, their\n\namalgamation, sub-divisions, etc. (S.18), power to withdraw planning area from\n\noperation of the Act (S.19) and constitution of Planning and Development Authorities\n\nfor the planning area (S.20). <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_138\">Section 22</a>, which enumerates functions and powers of\n\nPlanning and Development Authority reads as under:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_195\">\n\n\"22. Functions and powers of Planning and Development Authorities.--Subject to the\nprovisions of this Act and the rules framed thereunder and subject to any directions\nwhich the Government may give, the functions of every Planning and Development\nAuthority shall be -\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_196\">\n</p><p id=\"p_197\">(a) to prepare an existing Land Use Map;\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_198\">\n</p><p id=\"p_199\">(b) to prepare an Outline Development Plan;\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_200\">\n(c ) to prepare a Comprehensive Development plan;\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_201\">\n</p><p id=\"p_202\">(d) to prepare and prescribe uses of land within its area; and\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_203\">(e) to prepare schemes of development and undertake their implementation,\n\n\nand for these purposes, it may carry out or cause to be carried out, surveys of the\nplanning area and prepare report or reports of such surveys, and to perform such\nother functions as may be prescribed.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_204\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_205\">52.        Chapter VII of the Town and Country Planning Act contains provisions\n\nrelating to control of development and use of land. <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_139\">Section 44</a> lays down that any\n\nperson intending to carry out any development in respect of, or change of use of, any\n\nland shall make an application in writing to the Planning and Development Authority\n\ffor permission in such form containing such particulars and accompanied by such\n\ndocuments and plans as may be prescribed. <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_140\">Section 44(2)(b)</a> and (c) deal with the\n\nsituation in which the Development Authority objects to the proposal for\n\ndevelopment, in which case the matter has to be placed before the Government for its\n\ndecision.   <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_141\">Section 44(3)</a> lays down that the Development Authority can grant\n\npermission, conditionally or unconditionally for carrying out any development or\n\nchange of use of the land. While doing so, the Development Authority is required to\n\ntake note of the provisions of the development plan, if any, in force, relevant bye-\n\nlaws, regulations, etc.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_206\">53.         None of the above noted provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act\n\nempowers the Board and/or the Development Authority to modify, amend, alter or\n\nchange an agreement entered into as per the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/1980025/\" id=\"a_142\">Section 41</a> of the 1894\n\nAct or allow violation thereof by the company. Therefore, the decision taken by the\n\nBoard in its meeting held on 20th June, 1991 and order dated 20th April, 1992 issued\n\nby the Development Authority were non est and the High Court rightly did not give\n\nany credence to those decisions while adjudicating the issue relating to legality of\n\nconstruction made on survey No.803 (new No.246/2).\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_207\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_208\">54.         We are also of the opinion that even the EDC which was empowered\n\nunder second part of Clause 4(viii) of the agreement to grant approval to the\n\nactivities relating to development could not have permitted construction/extension of\n\nthe hotel building on a portion of survey No.803 (new No.246/2). Any such decision\n\nby the EDC would also have been declared nullity on the ground of violation of the\n\nmandate of first part of Clause 4(viii) of the statutory agreement.\n</p><p id=\"p_209\">\f55.        The argument of Shri Divan that extension of the hotel building on 1000\n\nsq. mts. of survey No.803 (new No.246/2) falls within the definition of \"development\"\n\ncontained in Section 2(10) of the Town and Country Planning Act which\n\ncomprehends carrying out of building activities and, therefore, the High Court\n\nshould not have ordered demolition of the extended portion of the hotel, but we are\n\nunable to agree with him and reiterate that neither the Board nor the Development\n\nAuthority could sanction violation of agreement dated 26.10.1983.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_210\">56.        For the reasons stated above, we hold that the High Court did not commit\n\nany error by declaring that extension of the hotel building on 1000 sq. mts. of survey\n\nNo.803 (new No.246/2) is illegal and directed its demolition after following the\n\nprocedure prescribed under Clause 6 of agreement dated 26.10.1983.\n\n\n\nRe: 5.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_211\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_212\">57.        This question deserves to be answered in favour of the appellants. A\n\nreading of application dated 15.11.1978 made by appellant No.1 makes it clear that it\n\nhad no intention of making available the facilities of yoga centre, health club and\n\namenities like water sports to the general public.      Rather in paragraph 6 of its\n\napplication, appellant No.1 made it clear that the facilities provided by the hotel will\n\nbe open for use by non-residents also on membership basis.           Agreement dated\n\n26.10.1983 is totally silent on the issue of making the facilities created by the\n\nappellants open for public use without permission and payment of fees. Therefore, it\n\nis not possible to agree with Ms. Jaising that the facilities and amenities created by\n\nthe appellant should be made available to the general public free of costs.\n</p><p id=\"p_213\">\f58.           In the result, the appeals are dismissed. Since execution of most of the\n\ndirections given by the High Court remained stayed during the pendency of these\n\nappeals, we deem it proper to issue the following directions:-\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">      (i)     The appellants are allowed three months' time to demolish the extended\n\n              portion of the hotel building which was constructed on 1000 sq. mts. of\n\n              survey No.803 (new No.246/2) and, thereafter report the matter to the\n\n              Development Authority which shall, in turn, submit a report to that effect\n\n              to Goa Bench of the Bombay High Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">      (ii)    If the appellants fail to demolish the building and report the matter to the\n\n              Development Authority within the time specified in direction No.(i) above,\n\n              the concerned authority shall take action in accordance with paragraphs\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">              (a) and (b) of the operative part of the High Court's order.\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">      (iii)   The access shown in plan Exhibit-A attached to Writ Petition No.141/1992\n\n              shall be kept open without any obstruction of any kind from point `A' to\n\n              `B' in order to come from Machado's Cove and then go to the beach\n\n              beyond point `B'.

The latter submitted an application to Gram Panchayat Taleigao\n\n(for short `the Gram Panchayat') for grant of permission to construct hotel complex\n\nnear Vainguinim beach. On a reference made by the Gram Panchayat, Chief Town\n\nPlanner, Government of Goa, Daman and Diu vide his letter dated 1.8.1978 informed\n\nthat the plans submitted by respondent No.1 are in conformity with the regulations in\n\nforce in the area but observed that right of the public to access the beach must be\n\nmaintained by providing necessary footpath.

The parking facilities provided will\nalso have to take care of the parking of vehicles of such members of the public in an\nappropriate manner.

In paragraphs 67 and 76 of the reply affidavit, it was averred\n\n         that part of the project, i.e., hotel is complete and has started functioning.\n\n         In paragraph 79, it was averred that besides the hotel project, cottages\n\n         were proposed to be constructed on plot bearing survey No. 805 and the\n\n         acquired land in survey Nos. 803 and 804 will be used for putting up\n\n         health club, yoga centre, water sports and other recreational facilities,\n\f        which are integral part of the project.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_238\">(x)     By an order dated 26.06.1984, Goa Bench of the High Court of Bombay\n\n        allowed the writ petition and quashed the impugned notifications only on\n\n        the ground of non compliance of Rule 4 of the Rules. That order was\n\n        reversed by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/303393/\" id=\"a_147\">M/s Fomento Resorts and Hotels Ltd. vs.\n\n        Gustavo Renato Da Cruz Pinto and Others</a> [(1985) 2 SCC 152] and the\n\n        case was remitted to the High Court for deciding other grounds of\n\n        challenge. It, however, appears that after the judgment of this Court, the\n\n        parties compromised the matter and the writ petition was withdrawn on\n\n        26.3.1985.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_239\">(xi)    In the meanwhile, respondent No. 1 entered into an agreement with the\n\n        Government as per the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/1759624/\" id=\"a_148\">Section 41</a> of the 1894 Act.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_240\">(xii)   After taking possession of the acquired land, Respondent No. 1 extended\n\n        the hotel building on survey Nos. 787, 788, 789 and 803 in the garb of\n\n        permission granted by the Development Authority under the Goa, Daman\n\n        and Diu Town and Country Planning Act, 1974. Respondent No. 1 also\n\n        closed public access to the beach available through survey No. 803 (new\n\n        No. 246/2). The same was challenged in Writ Petition No.330 of 1991 <a href=\"/doc/548160/\" id=\"a_149\">Shri\n\n        Minguel Martins vs. M/s Sociedade</a> e Fomento Industries Pvt.

The High Court further directed that access\n\n        to the beach shown in plan Exhibit-A filed along with Writ Petition\n\f         No.141/1992 shall be kept open without obstruction of any kind.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_241\">(xiii)   Shri Victor Albuquerque and the appellants herein filed another set of\n\n         Writ Petition Nos. 284 of 1991 and 37 of 1992 for issue of a direction to the\n\n         respondents (including respondent Nos. 1 and 2 herein) for restoration of\n\n         public access to Vainguinim beach and the car parking area through\n\n         survey No. 787 (new no. 246/1) and for demolition of the construction\n\n         made in the open area of survey No. 789 (new No. 246/4).\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_242\">(xiv)    In their writ petition, the appellants claimed that while approving the plan\n\n         for construction of hotel project in survey No. 787 (new No. 246/1), the\n\n         Chief Town Planner had directed respondent Nos. 1 and 2 to maintain\n\n         access to the beach through that survey number by providing necessary\n\n         footpath and also provide facility for parking of the vehicles and this was\n\n         reiterated by the Gram Panchayat, but respondent Nos. 1 and 2 have\n\n         shifted access to the beach to another location on the basis of permission\n\n         allegedly granted by the Sarpanch who had no authority to do so.\n\n         According to the appellants, respondent Nos. 1 and 2 were and are not\n\n         entitled to shift the public access to some other location and, as a matter of\n\n         fact, instead of ending at the beach, new road leads to the rocks through\n\n         which public cannot go to the beach. It was also the appellants' case that\n\n         the location of new road is extremely dangerous because it is adjacent to\n\n         10,000 Kg. poisonous gas tank.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_243\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_244\">(xv)     In their counter-affidavit, respondent Nos. 1 and 2 pleaded that the\n\n         sanction accorded by the Chief Town Planner was subject to the condition\n\n         that public access to the beach should be maintained by providing\n\n         necessary footpath at appropriate place and facilities should be provided\n\n         for parking of the vehicles but no particular location was identified for\n\f      that purpose.   It was further their case that in the first instance, car\n\n      parking was identified at North-East corner of property bearing survey\n\n      No. 787 and the footpath alongside its Eastern boundary, but during\n\n      execution of the project, it was found that existence of road near 10,000\n\n      Kg. poisonous gas tank, high pressure water tank, electric transformer will\n\n      be dangerous to the public and, therefore, application was made to the\n\n      Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat for shifting the location of public road,\n\n      car parking and footpath and construction thereof at the new site was\n\n      undertaken after seeking permission from the Sarpanch. Respondent Nos.\n\n      1 and 2 also pleaded that since 1979 members of the public are using access\n\n      to the beach through alternative road and footpath.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_245\">(xvi) The High Court referred to letter dated 1.8.1978 of the Chief Town\n\n      Planner, letter dated 1.12.1978 of the Sarpanch, two letters dated 29th\n\n      September, 1979, one of which was written by respondent No. 1 to the\n\n      Sarpanch, and the other by the Sarpanch and held that even though access\n\n      provided by respondent Nos. 1 and 2 is not at the site initially approved by\n\n      the Gram Panchayat, the same is being maintained at the new location\n\n      since 1979. The High Court noted that while approving the plan prepared\n\n      by respondent No.1 for construction of hotel complex, the Chief Town\n\n      Planner did not identify the particular location at which public road, car\n\n      parking and footpath were to be constructed and even when inspection\n\n      was carried out on 16th October, no objection was raised to the change of\n\n      alignment of the public road etc. and, therefore, it cannot be said that\n\n      respondents have violated the conditions of sanction. The High Court also\n\n      took cognizance of the photographs produced by the writ petitioners and\n\n      observed that the access to the beach is not maintained in proper manner\n\n      and that the same leads to rocks and is inaccessible during high tide.\n\f          Accordingly, directions were issued to the respondents to maintain tarred\n\n          road of three meters width throughout, proper area for parking of cars\n\n          and ensure that the access goes up to beach. However, the prayer of the\n\n          writ petitioners for demolition of the construction made in survey No. 789\n\n          (new No. 246/4) was rejected by observing that the so-called construction\n\n          is in the form of road and there is no legal prohibition against such\n\n          construction.    The relevant extracts of paragraphs 12 and 13 of the\n\n          impugned order which also contain the directions given by the High Court\n\n          read as under:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_246\"> \"All said and done, once, it is not in dispute that the members of the public are\nentitled to have their access through the property bearing survey no. 787, it cannot be\ndisputed the Respondents are duty bound to maintain a proper access for the public\nto the said beach and sufficient area for parking of cars. Both these things are to be\nmaintained through and in the property bearing survey no. 787. It is the contention\nof the Respondents that they have already provided such access and that the same is\nbeing used by the public. However, the photographs of such access which are placed\non record by the Petitioners and not disputed by the Respondents clearly disclose\nthat such access is not maintained in proper manner and/or as is otherwise required\nto be maintained in terms of the directions given by the Chief Town Planner. It is the\ncontention of the Petitioners that the said access leads not to the beach but to the\nrocks and the beach is absolutely unaccessable during the hightide by the said access.\nThe fact that members of the public cannot have access to the beach during the high\ntide is also admitted by the respondents in the Affidavit-in-replies filed in both the\nPetitions. In Writ Petition No. 37/92, it has been clearly stated in Affidavit-in-reply\nin para 20 \"and that the Respondents state that in compliance with the said condition\nfrom the point of steps, where also there is a jetty the Respondents built retaining\nwall with access over it to the extent of 60 metres giving access over it to the public\nthrough the beach even during the high tide\". Similarly, in Writ Petition No. 284/91\nin the Affidavit-in-reply it is stated in para 13(d) that \"the Respondents state that in\ncompliance with the said condition from the point of steps where also there was a\njetty, the Respondents have built a retaining wall with access over it giving access to\nthe public through the beach even during the high tide.\" The Affidavit-in-reply in\nWrit Petition No. 284/91 was filed in September, 1991 whereas the Affidavit-in-reply\nin Writ Petition No. 37/92 was filed in January, 1992. This clearly shows that the\nRespondents are fully aware that the access which has been stated to have been\nmaintained by the Respondents as it stands today is not at all convenient for free\naccess to the public to the said beach. Once, it is not disputed that the public have\nright to free access to the beach through the said property and the project of\nconstruction of hotel was approved with the condition that such access is to be\nmaintained, it is the duty of the Respondents to maintain a proper access through the\nproperty to the beach. It has been stated across the bar and delineated in a sketch\nproduced by the Petitioners and not disputed by the Respondents that alternative\naccess as exists at present provided by the Respondents for the public is through the\nwestern half of the property bearing old survey no. 787. It leads to the steps\nconstructed near the retaining wall by the side of the jetty leading to the sea situated\n\fon the said Vainguinim Beach. Once, it is clear that the said access does not lead to\nthe beach directly but to the steps and further to the rocks, it is necessary to give\nappropriate directions to the Respondents to extend the said access upto the beach\nalong the retaining wall referred to in para 20 of the Affidavit-in-reply in Writ\nPetition No. 37/92 to such an extent that the said access directly leads to the said\nbeach and not to the rocks or some other place. It is also necessary that such road\nshould be maintained of 3 metres in width all throughout, and also that the said road\nto be tarred and maintained in proper condition. The Respondents shall also\nmaintain proper area for parking of the cars and the area should be maintained in a\nusable condition for the members of the public and the responsibility in that regard\nshall also be of the Respondent Nos. 1 and 2. There shall not be any obstruction\ncaused on the said access or car park area either by construction of any fencing or\nany gate or otherwise and the same should be kept open all 24 hours of day and\nnight.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_247\">13.                   Considering the fact that neither of the parties have bothered to\nplace on record a proper plan with dimension and to scale, a further direction in that\nregard is necessary to the Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 who shall file a proper plan\ndrawn by a recognized surveyor showing the location of the access and car park\nmaintained in accordance with directions of this Court and such plan should be filed\nalong with the Affidavit regarding the compliance of maintenance of such access\nwithin a period of four weeks from today. The said access shall be at the location\ncorresponding to the one disclosed in the sketch produced by the Respondents and\nplaced on record and marked at `X' for identification. However, an alteration in the\nlocation of the access shall be made as regards the space near the gas tank shown in\nthe said sketch and sufficient space should be maintained from the location of the gas\ntank so as to avoid hardship or injury to the members of the public using the said\naccess and the distance between the gas tank and the access shall not be less than 20\nmetres under any circumstances. It shall also be the responsibility of the Respondent\nNo.5 in Writ Petition No. 37/92 as well as other authorities to have periodical checks\nand to ensure the maintenance of the said access and the car park area in the said\nproperty.\"\n</p><p id=\"p_248\">                                                                  [underlining is ours]\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_249\">2.                    Ms. Indira Jaising, learned senior counsel appearing for the\n\nappellants argued that even though the letter dated 1.8.1978 of the Chief Town\n\nPlanner did not identify the location where footpath and parking facilities were\n\nrequired to be provided by respondent Nos. 1 and 2 for access to the beach, but if the\n\nsame is read in conjunction with permission granted by the Gram Panchayat vide\n\nletter dated 22.8.1978 and letter dated 1.12.1978 of the Sarpanch, it becomes clear\n\nthat respondent Nos. 1 and 2 were required to provide parking area, on the north-\n\neast corner of survey No. 787 adjacent to survey No. 803 and public footpath was to\n\nbe provided in a manner that it would run on survey No. 787 and form the boundary\n\fof survey No. 803 but they manipulated the so-called permission from the Sarpanch\n\nof the Gram Panchayat and changed the location of public road and car parking.\n\nShe vehemently argued that access provided at the new site ends on the rocks and it is\n\nimpossible for the public to go to the beach even during the normal period what to\n\nsay of high tide period and the High Court committed grave error by declining the\n\nappellants' prayer for issue of mandamus to respondent Nos. 1 and 2 to provide\n\naccess to the beach through survey No. 787 in terms of the approval accorded by the\n\nChief Town Planner vide his letter dated 1.8.1978 read with the permission granted\n\nby the Gram Panchyat on 22.8.1978. Shri Anil B. Divan, learned senior counsel\n\nappearing for the respondents, submitted that the directions given by the High Court\n\nare just and proper and do not call for interference, because public road, car parking\n\nand access to the beach had been constructed in 1979 after obtaining permission from\n\nthe Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat and public has been using the same for last\n\nalmost 20 years. Learned senior counsel produced some photographs to show that\n\ntarred road has been constructed and access provided through footpath goes right up\n\nto the beach.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_250\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_251\">3.                   We have considered the respective submissions. Since it is not\n\nin dispute that respondent Nos. 1 and 2 have provided access to the beach at the\n\nalternative site in 1979 and the same is in existence for last almost 20 years and is\n\nbeing used by the public, it is not possible to agree with Ms. Indira Jaising that the\n\nHigh Court committed an error by not taking cognizance of the approval accorded\n\nby the Chief Town Planner and the permission granted by the Gram Panchayat on\n\n22.8.1978. It is true that Sarpanch did not place before the Gram Panchayat letter\n\ndated 29.9.1979 written by respondent No.1 for permission to change the location of\n\nthe footpath and parking area from the site originally sanctioned and the Gram\n\nPanchayat did not pass any resolution sanctioning such change, but the fact remains\n\fthat pursuant to letter dated 29.9.1979 written by the Sarpanch of the Gram\n\nPanchayat, respondent No.1 laid access to the beach at alternative site and made it\n\noperational sometime in 1979 and the same is being used by the public since then.\n\nThe photographs produced during the hearing of the appeal also prima facie show\n\nthat access to the beach is available at the alternative site. It is not the appellants'\n\npleaded case that they were unaware of the change of location of public access to the\n\nbeach and construction of road, parking area, etc. at the alternative site in 1979.\n\nTherefore, the writ petition filed by them in 2000 was highly belated, and the High\n\nCourt may have been justified in non-suiting them only on the ground of delay.\n\nHowever, as the High Court has dealt with the matter on merits, we do not consider it\n\nnecessary to deal with this issue in detail, more so because we are convinced that the\n\ndirections given by the High Court to respondent Nos. 1 and 2 for ensuring that\n\npublic road is shifted from the site near 10,000 Kg. poisonous gas tank and access to\n\nthe beach ends on the beach and not on the rocks are just and proper and are in\n\nconsonance with public interest.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_252\">\n</p><p id=\"p_253\">4.                    In the result appeal is dismissed.      Needless to say that if\n\nrespondent Nos. 1 and 2 have not carried out the directions given by the High Court\n\nin toto and access to the beach still ends at the rock or there is any other deficiency\n\nin the implementation of the order impugned in this appeal, then the appellants or\n\nany other interested person shall be free to bring this to the notice of the High Court\n\nfor appropriate order and action.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_254\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_255\">                                                                        ......................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_256\">                                                [B.N.

The respondent No.2 belongs to the West Bengal\n\n     Police      Service    and     was    posted        as     Deputy\n\n     Superintendent         of      Police         (D.N.T.)           at\n\n     Behrampore, District Murshidabad, West Bengal.\n\n     On 9th September, 2005, at about 9.15/9.30 in\n\n     the morning one Samiul Choudhury, the husband\n\n     of    the   appellant       herein,    was        shot    at   and\n\n     suffered     grievous      injury     to   his      right      eye.\n\n     Thereafter, in a statement given by him to the\n\n     Inspector      in-charge       of     Behrampore           Police\n\n     Station, he claimed that the assailants were\n\n     the associates of Mohan Lal,                  Jalal, Kamal,\n\n     Babul and Kabir of Zamindar para. On the basis\n\n     of the said statement Behrampur Police Station\n\n     Case    No.348     dated     9.11.2005       was    registered\n\n     under <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_4\">Sections 326</a>/<a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_5\">307</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_6\">120-B</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_7\">34</a> IPC read with\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/73862/\" id=\"a_8\">Sections 25</a>/<a href=\"/doc/244673/\" id=\"a_9\">27</a> of the Arms Act.

In the aforesaid complaint it was alleged that\n\n     on 9.11.2005 Samiul Choudhury was shot at near\n\n     his house and thereafter he was admitted to\n\n     the Behrampore New General Hospital and police\n\n     investigation was started. It was also alleged\n\n     that      on      the       pretext       of       conducting\n\n     investigation the respondent No.2 and his co-\n\n     accused    used       to   come    to   the    house    of   the\n\n     appellant and on 18th December, 2005 and also\n\n     on 19th   December, 2005, the respondent No.2\n\n     and the other accused came to the house of the\n\n     appellant       and     threatened      her     husband      and\n\n     wanted the husband of the appellant to make a\n\n     tutored statement and under threat even tried\n\n     to obtain his signature on a blank paper. It\n\n     was also claimed that the appellant's husband\n\n     lodged    a    complaint      with      the     local     police\n\n     authorities and higher authorities also but no\n\n     action    was     taken      and    the       appellant      was,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                                                   4</span>\n\n\n     therefore,       compelled        to   move        the    Chief\n\n     Judicial Magistrate Murshidabad by way of the\n\n     said complaint.          The learned Magistrate took\n\n     cognizance of the offence by his order dated\n\n     26.9.2004 and transferred the case to the 2nd\n\n     Court of Judicial Magistrate, Behrampore, for\n\n     inquiry and trial.          After transfer of the case\n\n     the appellant and her husband were examined on\n\n     solemn affirmation by the learned Magistrate\n\n     on 14.2.2006 and summons were directed to be\n\n     issued under <a href=\"/doc/1944660/\" id=\"a_13\">Sections 384</a>/<a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_14\">506</a> IPC.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">5.   Being aggrieved by the cognizance taken and\n\n     the issuance of process the respondent No.2\n\n     moved the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_15\">Sections 397</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_16\">401</a>\n\n     read with <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. for quashing the\n\n     cognizance       taken      and   also    the       issue     of\n\n     process.        The main ground of challenge was\n\n     that    being    in   the    employment       of   the    State\n\n     Government      the   respondent       No.2    enjoyed       the\n\n     protection of <a href=\"/doc/12704/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C. and that no\n\n     Court   could     take   cognizance      of     the      offence\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                                               5</span>\n\n\nalleged    to     have     been     committed          by     the\n\nrespondent      No.2     except     with    the        previous\n\nsanction of the State Government.                It was also\n\ncontended that the complaint disclosed that\n\nthe offence was alleged to have been committed\n\nby the respondent No.2 during the course of\n\ninvestigation      in    connection       with       Behrampore\n\nPolice Station Case No.348 dated 9.11.2005,\n\nand,   accordingly,       such     offence,      if     at    all\n\ncommitted,       had     been      committed          by      the\n\nrespondent      No.2     while    discharging          official\n\nduties which brought him within the protective\n\numbrella of <a href=\"/doc/12704/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C. In support of\n\nthe aforesaid contention made on behalf of the\n\nrespondent      No.2    reliance    was    placed       on    the\n\ndecision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1212531/\" id=\"a_20\">Sankaran Moitra vs.\n\nSadhna    Das   and     another</a>    [(2006)       4    SCC    584]\n\nwherein after considering various case law on\n\nthe subject the majority view was that the\n\nimportant criteria to be applied with regard\n\nto the invocation of <a href=\"/doc/1731569/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 197</a> of the Code\n\nwas that the act complained of must have been\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                                                            6</span>\n\n\n     performed in discharge of or in the purported\n\n     discharge of duty. This Court ultimately, came\n\n     to     the     conclusion             that       dispensing         with\n\n     jurisdictional or statutory requirements could\n\n     ultimately affect the adjudication itself and\n\n     could result in loss of public confidence in\n\n     the     institution.                 The      High       Court       was,\n\n     therefore, of the view that in the facts of\n\n     the     case        it     was       quite       clear       that    the\n\n     proceedings          before         the    Magistrate        had     been\n\n     vitiated       in    the       absence      of    sanction         having\n\n     been     obtained              for        prosecution         of     the\n\n     respondent          No.2       in    terms       of    <a href=\"/doc/12704/\" id=\"a_22\">Section        197</a>\n\n     Cr.P.C.

The question posed was whether the\n\n     case was covered by <a href=\"/doc/12704/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C. and\n\n     whether     previous          sanction            of     the     superior\n\n     authority was necessary before the trial Court\n\n     could take cognizance of the case.

Having    considered      the       submissions        made    on\n\n      behalf    of    the     respective        parties,      we    are\n\n      inclined to agree with the submissions made by\n\n      Mr.Pijush K. Roy on behalf of the appellant.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">14.   The direction which had been given by this\n\n      Court,    as    far    back    as    in    1971   in    Bhagwan\n\n      Prasad Prasad Srivastava's case (supra) holds\n\n      good even today. All acts done by a public\n\n      servant    in    the    purported         discharge     of    his\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                                               1</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                                               2</span>\nofficial duties cannot as a matter of course\n\nbe brought under the protective umbrella of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/12704/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C. On the other hand, there\n\ncan be cases of misuse and/or abuse of powers\n\nvested in a public servant which can never be\n\nsaid    to   be   a    part    of   the    official      duties\n\nrequired to be performed by him. As mentioned\n\nin Bhagwan Prasad Srivastava's case (supra),\n\nthe underlying object of <a href=\"/doc/12704/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C is\n\nto enable the authorities to scrutinize the\n\nallegations made against a public servant to\n\nshield him/her against frivolous, vexatious or\n\nfalse    prosecution          initiated     with   the     main\n\nobject of causing embarrassment and harassment\n\nto the said official. However, as indicated\n\nhereinabove,      if    the     authority       vested    in       a\n\npublic   servant       is     misused     for   doing    things\n\nwhich are not otherwise permitted under the\n\nlaw, such acts cannot claim the protection of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/12704/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C. and have to be considered\n\nde hors the duties which a public servant is\n\nrequired to discharge or perform.                  Hence, in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">\f                                                                  1</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                                                  3</span>\n      respect of prosecution for such excesses or\n\n      misuse    of     authority,    no     protection    can     be\n\n      demanded by the public servant concerned.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_24\">15.   In the instant case, certain deeds and acts\n\n      have been attributed to the respondent No.2\n\n      and another accused, which cannot be said to\n\n      have been part of the official duties to be\n\n      performed by respondent No.2. Hence, in our\n\n      view, the respondent No.2 was not entitled to\n\n      the   protection       of   <a href=\"/doc/12704/\" id=\"a_37\">Section      197</a>   Cr.P.C.     in\n\n      respect of such acts.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_25\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_26\">16.   While dealing with the aforesaid question, the\n\n      High Court appears to have been swayed by the\n\n      submissions made on behalf of the respondent\n\n      No.2 that since in the complaint the acts of\n\n      extortion        and   criminal       intimidation       were\n\n      alleged     to     have     been    committed      by      the\n\n      respondent        No.2      and       co-accused         while\n\n      conducting       investigation      in    connection     with\n\n      Behrampore Police Station Case No. 348 dated\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">\f                                                                          1</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                                          4</span>\n      9.11.2005,       such      offences         were      purported     to\n\n      have    been    committed         by    the      respondent       No.2\n\n      while discharging official duties.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_27\">17.    We have already indicated that we are unable\n\n      to accept       such      a    view.        In     our   view,     the\n\n      offences complained of cannot be said to part\n\n      of   the    duties      of     the     Investigating         Officer\n\n      while investigating an offence alleged to have\n\n      been committed.           It was no part of his duties\n\n      to threaten the complainant or her husband to\n\n      withdraw the complaint.                 In order to apply the\n\n      bar of <a href=\"/doc/12704/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C. each case has to be\n\n      considered in its own fact situation in order\n\n      to   arrive     at    a       finding    as      to    whether     the\n\n      protection       of    <a href=\"/doc/12704/\" id=\"a_39\">Section        197</a>     Cr.P.C.     could     be\n\n      given      to   the       public       servant.          The      fact\n\n      situation in the complaint in this case is\n\n      such that it does not bring the case within\n\n      the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 197</a> and the High Court\n\n      erred      in   quashing        the     same     as    far   as    the\n\n      respondent No.2 is concerned. The complaint\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">\f                                                                      1</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                                                      5</span>\n        prima facie makes out offences alleged to have\n\n        been committed by the respondent No.2 which\n\n        were not part of his official duties.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_28\">18.

MUKUNDAKAM SHARMA, J\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_2\">1. The issue that falls for our consideration in this appeal is in respect of a\n\n   demand of Rs. 61,000/- per gross acre, raised by the second respondent\n\n   towards the external development charges but actually on account of\n\n   construction of internal community buildings, with a further stipulation\n\n   that no such charge would be realised from the plot holders.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_3\">2. The appellant has challenged the said demand of the second respondent\n\n   as unlawful being contrary to the statutory provisions pertaining to the\n\n   construction of internal community buildings, which only mandates\n\n   transfer of land free of cost to the Government, if the Government so\n\n   desires, but without providing for any amount chargeable from the\n\f   licensee to the Government for the construction of these internal\n\n   community buildings.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">3. These challenges are made by way of filing the present appeal which is\n\n   filed against the judgment and order of the Division Bench of the Punjab\n\n   and Haryana High Court dated 29.07.1999 whereby the writ petition\n\n   filed by the appellant was dismissed.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">4. Appellant is a public limited company registered and incorporated under\n\n   the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_1\">Companies Act</a>, 1956 and is into the business of real estate\n\n   development and development of colonies. Since 1983, the appellant\n\n   Company had been granted licenses by the Director, Town and Country\n\n   Planning (for short \"Director\") being respondent No. 2 herein under the\n\n   provisions of Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act,\n\n   1975 (for short the \"Act\") and Haryana Development and Regulation of\n\n   Urban Areas Rules, 1976 (for short the \"Rules\") for setting up colonies\n\n   in the District Gurgaon, Haryana. For the said purpose, agreements were\n\n   entered into from time to time between the appellant Company and\n\n   respondent No. 2 in the prescribed form i.e. LC-IV, under Rule 11 of the\n\n   Rules. The said licenses were renewed from time to time.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                Page 2 of 32</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">\f5. As per clause 1 of the Licence Agreement, the licensee is required to\n\n   fulfil the conditions laid down in Rule 11 of the Rules. However, before\n\n   we go into the various terms and conditions of the licence, we think it to\n\n   be useful to refer to and extract some of the relevant provisions of the\n\n   Act read with the Rules. The said Act and Rules were framed to regulate\n\n   the use of the land, in order to prevent ill planned urbanization in or\n\n   around the towns in the State of Haryana and the same inter alia governs\n\n   the grant of licence for colonizing upon terms set out in the licence\n\n   agreement, which is given in the statutory form namely Form LC-IV.\n\n   The relevant provisions of the Act are quoted hereunder:-\n\n      \"S.2.

In the present case, the respondent No. 2 by letter dated 11.01.1988\n\n   informed the appellant Company that it was required to pay due amount\n\n   of Rs. 3.72 lacs per gross acre on account of external development\n\n   charges. It was also mentioned in the said letter that an amount of Rs.\n\n   3.72 lacs per gross acre, in fact includes Rs. 61,000/- per gross acre on\n\n   account of internal community buildings for which no recovery should\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                               Page 13 of 32</span>\n\fbe made from the plot holders. It was also mentioned in the said letter\n\nthat credit would be given by Haryana Urban Development Authority for\n\nthe internal community buildings already constructed by the colonizer\n\nnamely the appellant. Again under letter dated 07.10.1993, the appellant\n\nCompany was informed that before its licence could be considered for\n\nrenewal, the appellant Company was required to pay the aforementioned\n\ncharges. Subsequently on 04.05.1994, respondent No. 2 issued letter to\n\nthe appellant informing that the licence of the appellant would be\n\nrenewed only after the deposit of the aforesaid amount.   Aggrieved by\n\nthe aforesaid letter, the appellant Company made several representations\n\nto respondent Nos. 1 and 2 contending inter alia that as per the licence\n\nagreement and also as per the provisions of the Act and the Rules the\n\nappellant Company was not liable to pay the amount of Rs. 61,000/- per\n\ngross acre towards the construction of internal community buildings. It\n\nwas also submitted in the said representations by the appellant that the\n\nDirector had wrongly included the above said amount and the said\n\ndemand was not only unjust and arbitrary but also contrary to licence\n\nagreement and also against the provisions of the Act and the Rules\n\nframed thereunder.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_69\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                            Page 14 of 32</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_70\">\f10. As its aforesaid representations did not bear any fruits, the appellant\n\n   Company filed a writ petition before the Punjab and Haryana High Court\n\n   challenging the demand letters dated 11.1.1988, 17.10.1993 and\n\n   4.5.1994 to the extent of demand for Rs. 61,000/- per acre (and interest\n\n   thereon) on account of internal community buildings, by including it in\n\n   the external development charges. The appellant also contended inter\n\n   alia that as per provisions, the licensee was required to construct at his\n\n   own cost either itself or through an institution or individual, the schools,\n\n   hospitals,   community centres and other community buildings or to\n\n   transfer to Government free of cost the land set apart for schools,\n\n   hospitals, community centres and other community buildings.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_71\">11. It was further submitted that in terms of the aforesaid provision, the\n\n   appellant licensee was not required to pay for the development of those\n\n   buildings in case the land is transferred to the Government free of cost.\n\n   It was also pointed out by the appellant that in fact such a demand made\n\n   by the respondent No. 2 is beyond the competence of the Government as\n\n   any payment made for such development would not only be against the\n\n   provision of the Act and the Rules framed thereunder but would also be\n\n   against the principles of unjust enrichment.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_72\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                 Page 15 of 32</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_73\">\f12. The Punjab and Haryana High Court considered the aforesaid Writ\n\n  Petition and thereafter by the impugned judgment and order dated\n\n  29.7.1999 rejected the contentions of the appellant holding that the\n\n  appellant had failed to develop the said buildings which it was obliged to\n\n  do and thus the Director was justified in demanding the said amount\n\n  from the appellant Company which would be invested for the\n\n  construction of these buildings only. Aggrieved by the said judgment\n\n  and order, the present appeal is preferred by the appellant Company on\n\n  which we have heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_74\">13. The aforesaid contentions which were raised by the appellant in the\n\n  various representations submitted were reiterated before us by Mr. Arun\n\n  Jaitley, the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant. It was\n\n  further submitted by him that the Director, respondent No. 2 herein,\n\n  while making the unlawful demand of Rs. 61,000/- per gross acre in the\n\n  name of construction of internal community buildings, had acted\n\n  arbitrarily, unfairly and unreasonably inasmuch as he had no power or\n\n  authority to include the cost of internal community buildings in the\n\n  external development charges.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_75\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_76\">14. Mr. Anoop G. Chaudhary, learned senior counsel appearing for\n\n  respondent No. 2, however, took up various pleas in order to support the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                               Page 16 of 32</span>\n\f   demand made by the respondent No. 2. It was submitted by him that the\n\n   entire transaction and the demand made is covered by the Act and the\n\n   Rules framed thereunder.         He submitted that the appeal is liable to be\n\n   dismissed as the writ petition itself was not maintainable, inasmuch as,\n\n   the contention of the appellant is that the impugned demand made is\n\n   outside the provisions of the Act and the Rules and therefore the actual\n\n   remedy that was available to the appellant to challenge said demand was\n\n   by way of filing a civil suit.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_77\">      He also submitted that the present writ which is filed by the appellant\n\nis in the nature of claim for rendition of accounts for which the writ is not a\n\nproper remedy. He submitted that on both the aforesaid counts, the writ\n\npetition is required to be dismissed. He also submitted that the demand\n\nmade is within the jurisdiction and parameters laid down in <a href=\"/doc/1330413/\" id=\"a_9\">section 3(3)(a)</a>\n\n</p><p id=\"p_78\">(iv) of the Act and therefore, the challenge made to the aforesaid demand is\n\nunfair and unjustified.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_79\">      He also advanced an alternative argument contending inter alia that if\n\nthe aforesaid contentions are not accepted, even in that event, the entire\n\namount for which demand was raised has since been paid by the appellant\n\nand therefore, the principle of waiver and acquiescence will apply to the\n\nfacts and circumstances of the present case.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_80\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                    Page 17 of 32</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_81\">\f15. So far the contentions with regard to the maintainability of the writ\n\n   petition is concerned, we are not impressed and persuaded with the\n\n   aforesaid contentions as according to the respondent themselves, the\n\n   aforesaid demand is being made within the parameter and ambit of the\n\n   provision of <a href=\"/doc/1330413/\" id=\"a_10\">section 3(3)(a)(iv)</a>. That being the position, the demand\n\n   made according to the respondent is a statutory demand and therefore\n\n   challenge to such a demand could always be raised by the appellant by\n\n   filing a writ petition as such a demand is sought to be protected and\n\n   supported by way of statutory provision.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_82\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_83\">16. Even if the appellant has taken up the plea that such a demand is not\n\n   supported by the statutory provisions and is in fact in conflict with them,\n\n   even then the issue pertains as to whether or not such a demand could be\n\n   made and supported by the said provisions, in which case, a writ petition\n\n   is competent and maintainable and the plea raised by the respondent\n\n   therefore with regard to the maintainability of the petition is only to be\n\n   rejected which we hereby do.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_84\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_85\">17. <a href=\"/doc/1330413/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 3(3)(a)(iv)</a> of the Act is the relevant provision and the merit of\n\n   the claim and repudiation thereof is based on the interpretation of the\n\n   said provision. It was pointed out on behalf of the appellant that 49 plots\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                Page 18 of 32</span>\n\fhave been given by the appellant developer to the Government as\n\ncommunity sites. <a href=\"/doc/1230543/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 5</a> of the Act enumerates that colonizer would\n\ndeposit 50% of the amount realised from time to time by him from the\n\nplot holders within the period of 10 days of its realization in a separate\n\naccount to be maintained in a scheduled bank. It is also provided therein\n\nthat the aforesaid 50% amount which is so deposited would only be\n\nutilized towards meeting the cost of the internal development works in\n\nthe colony. Further stipulation in the said provision is that after the\n\ninternal development works of the colony have been completed to the\n\nsatisfaction of the Director, the colonizer would be at liberty to withdraw\n\nthe balance amount.      The remaining 50% of the amount would be\n\ndeemed to have been retained by the colonizer to meet the cost of the\n\nland and external development works. <a href=\"/doc/272099/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 8</a> of the Act which is\n\nextracted herein above also provides that the Director could cancel the\n\nlicence given to the developer colonizer if he contravenes any of the\n\nconditions of the licence or the provision of Act or the Rules made\n\nthereunder and after the cancellation of the licence, the Director may\n\nhimself carry out or cause to be carried out the development works in a\n\ncolony and recover such other charges as the Director may have to incur\n\non the said development work from the colonizer and the plot holders.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                             Page 19 of 32</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_86\">\f18. Rules 4, 5 and 11 which are made part of the statutory rules give effect to\n\n   the aforesaid provision of <a href=\"/doc/1330413/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 3(3)</a>. The comparative reading of the\n\n   provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1330413/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 3(3)(a)(iv)</a> and sub-clause (b) of clause (1) of the\n\n   Licence Agreement would clearly show that the licensee-colonizer is\n\n   required to construct at his own cost schools, hospitals, community\n\n   centres and other community buildings or may get the same constructed\n\n   by any other institution or individual. The developer also has the option\n\n   to transfer to the Government at any time, if so desired by the\n\n   Government, free of cost the land set apart for schools, hospitals,\n\n   community centres and community buildings in which case the\n\n   Government would be at liberty to transfer such land to any person or\n\n   institution including a local authority on such terms and conditions as it\n\n   may deem fit.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_87\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_88\">19. The said provision, therefore, gives three options for construction of\n\n   such community centres and facilities like schools, hospitals, community\n\n   centres and other community buildings.        Such centres and buildings\n\n   could be constructed by the developer himself or he may get the same\n\n   constructed by any other institution or individual whereby such\n\n   individual would be able to utilize the said building.     In    case   the\n\n   developer fails to exercise either of the aforesaid two options, a third\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                 Page 20 of 32</span>\n\f   option is also open to the developer under which he would transfer the\n\n   said land, where the community facilities are to be established, free of\n\n   cost to the Government in which case such schools, hospitals,\n\n   community centres and community buildings could be constructed either\n\n   by the Government itself or the said land could be transferred by the\n\n   Government to any person or institution including a local authority on\n\n   such terms and conditions as the Government may deem fit.             The\n\n   aforesaid provision is clear and explicit and there is no ambiguity in it.\n\n   The only question therefore, which arises herein is, in a case where the\n\n   land is transferred to the Government free of cost and when such\n\n   schools, hospitals, community centres and community buildings are to be\n\n   constructed either by the Government or any agency appointed by the\n\n   Government whether the charges for internal community buildings is\n\n   also required to be paid by the developer.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_89\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_90\">20. It was submitted by the counsel appearing for respondent No. 2 that the\n\n   demand is made by the State Government as external development\n\n   charges although the same is actually for making internal community\n\n   buildings which was in the interest of proper development of the said\n\n   colony. The High Court upheld the said contention on the ground that a\n\n   colonizer is duty bound to complete the development works in the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                Page 21 of 32</span>\n\f   colony within a specified period and that the idea behind providing such\n\n   a time limit was only to safeguard the interest of various plot\n\n   holders/residents of the colony so that they might not be left at the lurch\n\n   by the colonizer after selling plots to them. It was further held that since\n\n   a complete control over the activities of the colonizer is envisaged under\n\n   the provisions of the Act and the Rules, the action of the Director in\n\n   calling upon the appellant Company to pay charges for some of the\n\n   internal community buildings could not be termed as arbitrary.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_91\">21. The said findings arrived at by the learned Division Bench of the High\n\n   Court appears to be in direct conflict and also in contradiction with the\n\n   provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1330413/\" id=\"a_16\">Sections 3(3)(a)(iv)</a> of the Act and also all the terms and\n\n   conditions provided in sub-clause (b) of clause (1) of the Licence\n\n   Agreement.    There is no mention at all of any requirement for the\n\n   licensee to provide for or to make payment for the cost of construction of\n\n   internal community buildings when the land is transferred to the\n\n   Government free of cost. No such statutory basis could be shown either\n\n   in the statute or in the licence agreement. When a specific question was\n\n   put as to whether the amount was demanded towards internal community\n\n   buildings or external development charges, the learned counsel, was\n\n   constraint to admit that although the said amount was being demanded\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                 Page 22 of 32</span>\n\f   towards external development works but in fact the same was being\n\n   demanded from the appellant towards internal community buildings\n\n   which were required to be constructed by the appellant. There is no\n\n   dispute with regard to the fact that the developer of the colony, namely\n\n   the present appellant has carried out all the internal development works\n\n   as required to be done which is statutorily provided for. A part of the\n\n   community centre has also been constructed by the developer themselves\n\n   but the entire community centre could not be developed by it or through\n\n   its agencies and therefore the land allocated for the remaining\n\n   community buildings/development have been transferred to the\n\n   Government free of cost.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_92\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_93\">22. Since the land has been given free of cost, it is now open for the State\n\n   Government to get the remaining community buildings constructed\n\n   either by themselves or through any agency or institution or individual at\n\n   its cost in terms of the provisions of the Act, in which case the terms and\n\n   conditions could be laid down by the Government for such community\n\n   buildings, to be constructed on the land which is transferred to it by the\n\n   appellant free of cost. The Government cannot in law demand that the\n\n   buildings on the said lands which is to be transferred to them free of cost\n\n   should also be constructed by the appellant and then transfer the land to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                Page 23 of 32</span>\n\f   them free of cost along with the construction thereon and on failure to\n\n   construct to pay for the cost of construction. That would in fact be a\n\n   case of an illegal and unauthorised demand as it has no statutory\n\n   mandate. The respondent cannot demand transfer of the land free of cost\n\n   and also the construction cost of the facilities to be provided in the said\n\n   land.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_94\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_95\">23. When the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1330413/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 3(3)(a)(iv)</a> are analysed, it would be\n\n   apparent that the word used in the said provision is \"land\" and it has\n\n   been specifically mentioned therein that if the colonizer does not\n\n   construct the community buildings and facilities on its own or through\n\n   its agency or organization or individual, then the said licensee would be\n\n   required to transfer the said land set apart for the aforesaid purpose free\n\n   of cost to the Government.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_96\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_97\">24. The Government's claim is therefore restricted to lands which the\n\n   developer has failed to develop as community centres. In other words\n\n   only that land which the developer has not been able to develop as\n\n   community services facilities would stand transferred to the Government\n\n   free of cost and the said land could be utilized by the Government for the\n\n   aforesaid purpose either by itself or through its agency. If the legislature\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                 Page 24 of 32</span>\n\f   had intended that the licensee is required to transfer the land and also to\n\n   construct the buildings on it or to make payment for such construction,\n\n   the legislature would have made specific provisions laying down such\n\n   conditions explicitly and in clear words in which event the provisions\n\n   would have been worded in altogether different words and terms. It is\n\n   well settled principle in law that the court cannot read anything into a\n\n   statutory provision which is plain and unambiguous.         The language\n\n   employed in a statute is determinative factor of legislative intent. If the\n\n   language of the enactment is clear and unambiguous, it would not be\n\n   proper for the courts to add any words thereto and evolve some\n\n   legislative intent, not found in the statue.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_98\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_99\">25. <a href=\"/doc/126480447/\" id=\"a_18\">In Ganga Prasad Verma (Dr.) v. State of Bihar</a> [1995 Supp. (1) SCC\n\n   192], it has been held that where the language of the Act is clear and\n\n   explicit, the Court must give effect to it, whatever may be the\n\n   consequences, for in that case the words of the statute speak the intention\n\n   of the legislature.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_100\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_101\">26. Mr. Anoop G. Chaudhary, learned senior counsel wanted us to read the\n\n   provision of the <a href=\"/doc/1330413/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 3(3)(a)(iv)</a> of the Act by adding a few words to\n\n   it, for according to him the latter part of the aforesaid section i.e. the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                  Page 25 of 32</span>\n\f  obligation of the appellant to transfer to the Government at any time free\n\n  of cost the land, should be read by adding the provisions of the earlier\n\n  part of the section i.e. to construct at his own cost the community centres\n\n  and other community buildings on the lands set apart for this purpose.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_102\">27. The aforesaid contention apparently arises out of the complete\n\n  misreading of the aforesaid provision.       The responsibility regarding\n\n  construction of community centres and other community buildings could\n\n  be discharged by adopting any of the three options as mentioned\n\n  hereinbefore and each one of such options is an independent option and\n\n  one cannot be connected and related with the other. We cannot read the\n\n  provision relating to construction at the own cost of the developer the\n\n  schools, hospitals, community centres and other community buildings on\n\n  the land set apart for this purpose, into an independent alternative\n\n  provision relating to transfer of such land to the Government free of cost.\n\n  The aforesaid option given to the developer to construct the community\n\n  centres and other community buildings at its own cost is when he can\n\n  utilize himself manage it.    Therefore, we cannot read the aforesaid\n\n  provision in the manner sought to be read by Mr. Chaudhary, for reading\n\n  by adding certain words in the aforesaid manner does not appear to be\n\n  the intention of the legislature while enacting the aforesaid legislation,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                               Page 26 of 32</span>\n\f   for otherwise the legislature would have explicitly said so in the body of\n\n   the main part of the section itself.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_103\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_104\">28.Therefore, we not only reject the preliminary objections raised by the\n\n   respondent No. 2 in this matter, but we also reject his contention that the\n\n   aforesaid demand of Rs. 61,000/- per gross acre is permitted under the\n\n   provision of <a href=\"/doc/1330413/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 3(3)(a)(iv)</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_105\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_106\">29. We, therefore, now come to the last submission of the counsel appearing\n\n   for respondent No. 2 which relates to issue of waiver and acquiescence\n\n   in view of the fact that payment was made by the appellant which was\n\n   demanded from him under the aforesaid letters.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_107\">30. The correspondences between the parties in respect of payment of the\n\n   aforesaid demand would clearly establish that respondent No. 2 made a\n\n   demand for the payment of the aforesaid amount of Rs. 61,000/- per\n\n   gross acre failing which a threat was issued that the licence which was\n\n   issued to it would stand cancelled. It is also pointed out on behalf of the\n\n   respondent No. 2 that subsequently the respondent No. 2 has made it a\n\n   policy of including expressly the value of the community buildings in the\n\n   internal development works and ensuring that one fourth of the total cost\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                  Page 27 of 32</span>\n\fof the internal development work could be secured by a bank guarantee.\n\nIt is needless to say that if the provision would have been the same at the\n\nrelevant time, in that event the situation would have been different but\n\nno such provision either in the Act or in the Rules or in any policy\n\nframed by the Government could be brought to our attention. Therefore,\n\nwhat we were required to consider was only the explicit provision of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1330413/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 3(3)(a)(iv)</a> of the Act and the rules framed thereunder, which are\n\nextracted herein before in terms of which we find no obligation on the\n\npart of the appellant to pay for the construction of internal community\n\nbuildings which was being demanded by the appellant as external\n\ndevelopment charges. Charges for construction of internal community\n\nbuildings can never be equated with the external development charges,\n\nso the demand itself was illegal. The view taken by us also derive\n\nsupport from the judgment of this Court in          <a href=\"/doc/1119469/\" id=\"a_22\">DLF Qutab Enclave\n\nComplex Educational Charitable Trust v. State of Haryana</a>, [(2003)\n\n5 SCC 622] wherein it was held that construction of schools, hospitals\n\nand community centres and other community buildings does not come\n\nwithin the purview of the term \"development works\" as the same come\n\nwithin the purview of the term \"amenities\". The Court in Para 33 held as\n\nunder:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_108\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                             Page 28 of 32</span>\n\f     \"Construction of schools, hospitals and community centres and\n     other community buildings do not come within the purview of\n     the term \"development works\". They come within the purview\n     of the term \"amenities\". Only in relation to the development\n     works the colonizer is bound to pay the development charges,\n     carry out and complete development works. He has also the\n     responsibility to maintain the same for a period of five years\n     from the date of issue of the completion certification\n     whereafter, the same is required to be handed over to the\n     Government or the local authority as the case may be, free of\n     cost.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_109\">\n</p><p id=\"p_110\">31. Since the respondent No. 2 sought to justify the demand made on the\n\n  ground that such demand is justified as internal community building, we\n\n  have no other option but to hold that such demand could not have been\n\n  made even as internal community buildings for no such power and\n\n  jurisdiction was vested in the Government to make such a demand for\n\n  the simple reason that there was neither any statutory support nor any\n\n  policy decision in support of the same. Even in the Licence Agreement,\n\n  nothing was contemplated to the effect that in addition to the liability to\n\n  transfer the land set apart for the said buildings to the Government free\n\n  of cost, on the contingency mentioned in the statue and relied in the\n\n  Licence Agreement, the licensee is also required to pay for the\n\n  construction of said buildings.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_111\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                               Page 29 of 32</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_112\">\f32. So far the issue with regard to the waiver and acquiescence is concerned,\n\n   we find that such contention that the principles of waiver and\n\n   acquiescence is attracted to the facts of the case is also not tenable. In\n\n   the letter dated 08.02.1988 which was written by the appellant in\n\n   response to the letter of respondent No. 2 dated 11.01.1988 on the\n\n   subject of payment of external development charges, it was clearly stated\n\n   that the revised rates which is since determined by the Director in their\n\n   communication dated 18.9.1987 and its further revision are not covered\n\n   by the clause of the agreements being referred in the recent\n\n   communications. In paragraph 2 of the said letter it was specifically\n\n   stated that the respondent No. 2 had included an amount of Rs. 61,000/-\n\n   per gross acre on account of community buildings in the external\n\n   development charges, which is not payable, as according to the\n\n   requirements of the Act and licence the appellant was required to pay\n\n   external development charges only and there was no mention of charges\n\n   towards construction of internal community buildings in case the land set\n\n   apart for the said purpose is transferred to the Government free of cost.\n\n   Therefore there was a protest and demur on the part of the petitioner\n\n   against the aforesaid demand.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_113\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                Page 30 of 32</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_114\">\f33. In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1686005/\" id=\"a_23\">Municipal Corpn. of Greater Bombay v. Hakimwadi\n\n   Tenants' Assn</a>., [1988 Supp SCC 55], it was held by this Court that in\n\n   order to constitute waiver, there must be voluntary and intentional\n\n   relinquishment of a right. The essence of a waiver is an estoppel and\n\n   where there is no estoppel, there is no waiver. Estoppel and waiver are\n\n   questions of conduct and must necessarily be determined on the facts of\n\n   each case.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_115\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_116\">34. It is thus established that the appellant on receipt of the demand issued\n\n   by respondent No. 2 raised this objection regarding the charge and the\n\n   demand made and the payment which was made by the appellant was\n\n   due to the threat issued by respondent No. 2 that on failure of the\n\n   appellant to pay the same its licence would stand cancelled.         Such\n\n   demand was made by the appellant under protest as aforesaid.\n\n   Therefore, the principle of waiver and acquiescence will have no\n\n   application in the present case and therefore we reject the said contention\n\n   of the learned counsel appearing for respondent No. 2.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_117\">35. The appeal, therefore, stands allowed and we hold that respondent     No.\n\n   2 was not authorized or justified in raising the aforesaid demand of Rs.\n\n   61,000/- per gross acre.

Being aggrieved by the common judgment and order dated\n\n   17.04.2001 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of\n\n   Calcutta in Appeal Number 462 and 463 of 1992, allowing the\n\n   appeals filed by the respondent against the judgment of a learned\n\n   Single Judge, these civil appeals have been preferred where\n\n   special leave was granted.       Since both these appeals involve\n\n   similar questions of law and facts and arise out of the same\n\n   impugned order, we propose to dispose of both these appeals by\n\n   this common judgment and order.\n</p><p id=\"p_4\">\f2. The appellant Board which is having its base and operation at\n\n  Jaipur placed an order for supply of 50 kiloliter of transformer oil\n\n  with the respondent Company which is having its registered office\n\n  and manufacturing unit at Calcutta vide purchase order No.\n\n  RSEB/SE/Proc.I/TN-1261/U/Petrochemical/937 dated 23.9.1985\n\n  for an amount of Rs. 6,09,144/-. In terms of clause 5 of the said\n\n  purchase order, the respondent was required to deposit security in\n\n  the form of bank guarantee for an amount equivalent to 2 per cent\n\n  of the contract value.     In addition, the respondent was also\n\n  required to furnish a performance guarantee equivalent to 5 per\n\n  cent of the contract value for satisfactory performance and due\n\n  execution of the said contract.      Subsequent to the aforesaid\n\n  purchase order, an agreement was also entered into between the\n\n  parties on 16.10.1985 at Jaipur.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">3. Subsequently the appellant Board placed another purchase order\n\n  vide No. RSEB/SE/Proc.I/TN-1312/202 dated 02.12.1987 for\n\n  supply of 150 kiloliter of transformer oil for an amount of Rs.\n\n  19,50,000/-. Similar to the previous purchase order, in the present\n\n  purchase order also the respondent was required to furnish the\n\n  bank guarantee equivalent to 2 per cent of the contract value\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                            Page 2 of 23</span>\n\f     towards security deposit and equivalent to 5 per cent of the\n\n     contract value towards performance guarantee. Accordingly an\n\n     agreement was also entered into between the parties on 16.12.1987\n\n     at Jaipur.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">4. In terms of the abovesaid two purchase orders and agreements\n\n     thereon the respondent was required to furnish bank guarantee to\n\n     the tune of Rs. 1,79,200/-. In compliance to the said condition\n\n     with respect to the bank guarantee the respondent furnished four\n\n     bank guarantees for amounts of Rs. 12200/-, Rs. 30500/-, Rs.\n\n     39000/- and Rs. 97500/-. These guarantees were executed by the\n\n     Allahabad Bank at Jaipur Branch on behalf of their Main Branch\n\n     at Calcutta.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">5.    Before we proceed further it would be appropriate for us to\n\n     extract herein the relevant clauses with respect to adjudication of\n\n     the disputes, if any, which were common in both the agreements.\n\n     Clause 30 of the General Conditions of the Contract inter alia\n\n     stipulates as under:-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n        \"30.....The contract shall for all purposes be construed\n        according to the laws of India and subject to jurisdiction\n        of only at Jaipur in Rajasthan Courts only...........\"\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                               Page 3 of 23</span>\n\f      Clause 31 of the General Conditions of the Contract, which is\n\nan arbitration clause, reads as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      \"31.

Such\n             reference shall be deemed to be a submission to\n             the arbitration within the meaning of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_1\">Indian\n             Arbitration Act</a>, 1940 and the statutory\n             modifications made thereof.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      (b)       The award of the Arbitrator shall be final and\n             binding on both the parties.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">      (c)       Upon every or any such reference, the cost\n             incidental to such reference and an award shall be\n             in the discretion of the Arbitrator who may\n             determine the amount thereof and direct the same\n             to be borne and paid.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      (d)        Work under the Contract shall, if reasonably\n             possible, continue during the arbitration\n             proceedings and no payment due or payable by the\n             Purchaser shall be withheld on account of such\n             proceedings.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                              Page 4 of 23</span>\n<p id=\"p_11\">\f      In the second purchase order which is dated 02.12.1987, in\n\naddition to the above mentioned clauses, a clause was also\n\nincorporated which is with respect to the jurisdiction of the Court in\n\ncase of disputes:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      \"DISPUTES\n\n      All disputes, differences or questions whatever which\n      may arise between the Purchaser and the Supplier upon\n      or in relation with or in connection with the contract\n      shall be deemed to have arisen at Jaipur (Rajasthan) and\n      no Court other than the Court at Jaipur (Rajasthan) shall\n      have jurisdiction to entertain or try the same.\"</blockquote><p id=\"p_13\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">      A clause, namely, Clause 7 was also incorporated in the bank\n\nguarantee which is with respect to the jurisdiction of Courts for\n\nadjudication of disputes arising under the bank guarantee. The said\n\nclause reads as under:-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">      \"All disputes arising in the said Bank Guarantee between\n      the Bank and the Board or between the supplier or the\n      Board pertaining to this guarantee shall be subject to the\n      courts only at Jaipur in Rajasthan.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p_16\">6. Somehow the disputes arose between the parties. The appellant\n\n   alleged that the respondent has failed to perform his part of the\n\n   contract inasmuch as the respondent has supplied defective\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                             Page 5 of 23</span>\n\f  transformer oil and as such on receipt of such supply, the same\n\n  was rejected by the Board requiring the respondent to replace the\n\n  same. Thereafter the appellant took steps for invocation of the\n\n  bank guarantees in view of the fact that the respondent has failed\n\n  to adhere to the aforesaid requirement and also neglected to\n\n  replace the defective transformer oil.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_17\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">7. The respondent being aggrieved by the actions taken by the\n\n  appellant filed a petition under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 20</a> of The Arbitration Act,\n\n  1940 (for short the \"Act\") in the nature of a suit in the High Court\n\n  at Calcutta being Special Suit No. 70 of 1990. In the said suit, the\n\n  respondent also moved an application under <a href=\"/doc/28932/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 41</a> of the Act\n\n  seeking interim reliefs.     The appellant herein contested the\n\n  aforesaid suit. By an Order dated 06.03.1991, the learned Single\n\n  Judge of the High Court dismissed the petition and also vacated\n\n  the interim order which was passed earlier.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_19\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">8. On appeal being filed by the respondent, the said order of\n\n  06.03.1991 passed by the learned Single Judge was set aside and\n\n  the matter was remanded back for fresh consideration.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                             Page 6 of 23</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">\f9. Consequent upon the aforesaid order of remand, the learned Single\n\n   Judge again heard the suit and passed a similar order dismissing\n\n   the petition filed by the appellant under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 20</a> of the Act.\n\n   Being aggrieved by the said final order passed by the learned\n\n   Single Judge, two appeals were filed before the Division Bench\n\n   which were heard together and the same were allowed by the\n\n   Division Bench under the impugned order dated 17.04.2001.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">10.The said impugned judgment and order is under challenge in both\n\n   the appeals on which we heard the learned counsel appearing for\n\n   the parties who had taken us through the relevant documents. By\n\n   the impugned order, the Division Bench of the Calcutta High\n\n   Court held that the forum selection clause as appearing in the\n\n   agreements between the parties would not operate in view of the\n\n   specific prohibition under <a href=\"/doc/1684349/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 31(4)</a> of the Act. It was also\n\n   held that since the respondent had made an application before the\n\n   Calcutta High Court having competent jurisdiction to try and\n\n   decide the proceedings, the said Calcutta Court would be entitled\n\n   to exercise jurisdiction and that all subsequent applications would\n\n   be made to that Court only as first application was made in that\n\n   Court by the respondent. Consequently, the appeals were allowed\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                             Page 7 of 23</span>\n\f  and the judgment of the learned Single Judge was set aside. The\n\n  matter was directed to be listed before the Single Judge for passing\n\n  consequential orders in terms of the directions issued by the\n\n  Division Bench.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_23\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_24\">11.Contentions that were raised on behalf of the appellant in the\n\n  present appeals before us, revolves around the issue of territorial\n\n  jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court in entertaining the said\n\n  petition under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 20</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_25\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_26\">12.According to the appellant, the Calcutta High Court would have\n\n  no jurisdiction to entertain and decide the aforesaid petition under\n\n  <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 20</a> of the Act and that it is only the Court at Jaipur which\n\n  would have territorial jurisdiction to entertain and decide any such\n\n  petition filed by any of the party, in view of the specific intention\n\n  of the parties as disclosed from the stipulations in the purchase\n\n  order and agreements entered into between the parties.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_27\">13.The learned counsel for the respondent, on the other hand\n\n  submitted before us that the provision of <a href=\"/doc/1882318/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 31</a> of the Act is\n\n  clear and in terms thereof and in view of the specific prohibition\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                            Page 8 of 23</span>\n\f   therein any proceeding between the parties would have to be\n\n   instituted within the jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court and\n\n   therefore the impugned judgment and order passed by the High\n\n   Court of Calcutta is legal and valid.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_28\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_29\">14.In the light of the aforesaid submissions made by learned counsel\n\n   for both the parties, we proceed to decide the issues as to whether\n\n   or not the Calcutta High Court had territorial jurisdiction to\n\n   entertain the petition filed by the respondent under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 20</a> of\n\n   the Act as also the application filed under <a href=\"/doc/28932/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 41</a> of the Act\n\n   seeking interim orders and also as to whether it is the Jaipur Court\n\n   only which will have territorial jurisdiction to entertain any such\n\n   request. For proper appreciation of the points at issue, it would be\n\n   appropriate to set out the abovementioned legislative provisions of\n\n   the Act, which are as under:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_30\">\n</p><p id=\"p_31\">      20. Application to file in Court arbitration agreement.\n</p><p id=\"p_32\">      -(1) Where any persons have entered into an arbitration\n      agreement before the institution of any suit with respect\n      to the subject matter of the agreement or any part of it,\n      and where a difference has arisen to which the agreement\n      applies, they or any of them, instead of proceeding under\n      Chapter II, may apply to a Court having jurisdiction in\n      the matter to which the agreement relates, that the\n      agreement be filed in Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_33\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                              Page 9 of 23</span>\n\f(2) The application shall be in writing and shall be\nnumbered and registered as a suit between one or more\nof the parties interested or claiming to be interested as\nplaintiff or plaintiffs and the remainder as defendant or\ndefendants, if the application has been presented by all\nthe parties, or, if otherwise, between the applicant as\nplaintiff and the other parties as defendants.\n\n\n(3) On such application being made, the Court shall\ndirect notice thereof to be given to all parties to the\nagreement other than the applicants, requiring them to\nshow cause within the time specified in the notice why\nthe agreement should not be filed.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_34\">\n(4) Where no sufficient cause is shown, the Court shall\norder the agreement to be filed, and shall make an order\nof reference to the arbitrator appointed by the parties,\nwhether in the agreement or otherwise, or, where the\nparties cannot agree upon an arbitrator, to an arbitrator\nappointed by the Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_35\">\n(5) Thereafter the arbitration shall proceed in accordance\nwith, and shall be governed by, the other provisions of\nthis Act so far as they can be made applicable.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_36\">41.

The said\n\n   agreements admittedly also contained forum selection clauses\n\n   between the parties whereby and whereunder the parties agreed\n\n   that the said contracts and agreements, in relation to any dispute or\n\n   difference would be subject to the jurisdiction of courts at Jaipur\n\n   in Rajasthan.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_41\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_42\">16. Therefore, the issues which we are required to address here is\n\n   whether the ouster clause in the agreement between the parties will\n\n   also be applicable in ascertaining the competent court for making\n\n   an application for reference under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_11\">section 20</a> of the Act. As per\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/28932/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 41</a> (1) of the act the provisions of the Code of Civil\n\n   Procedure, 1908, (for short \"the Code\") shall apply to all\n\n   proceedings before the Court, and to all appeals, under the Act.\n\n   Section 20 of the Code, which is with respect to the jurisdiction of\n\n   courts for institution of suit, reads as under:\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                              Page 11 of 23</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_43\">\f      20.

There are number of decisions of this Court wherein it was held\n\n   that where there may be two or more competent courts which can\n\n   entertain a suit consequent upon a part of the cause of action\n\n   having arisen therein, if the parties to the contract agree to vest\n\n   jurisdiction in one such court to try the dispute which might arise\n\n   as between themselves, such agreement would be valid and\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                              Page 12 of 23</span>\n\f  binding. <a href=\"/doc/997135/\" id=\"a_13\">In A.B.C. Laminart (P) Ltd. v. A.P. Agencies</a> [(1989) 2\n\n  SCC 163], this Court stated thus;\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_49\">\n     \"21. From the foregoing decisions it can be reasonably\n     deduced that where such an ouster clause occurs, it is\n     pertinent to see whether there is ouster of jurisdiction of\n     other courts. When the clause is clear, unambiguous and\n     specific accepted notions of contract would bind the\n     parties and unless the absence of ad idem can be shown,\n     the other courts should avoid exercising jurisdiction. As\n     regards construction of the ouster clause when words like\n     \"alone\", \"only\", \"exclusive\" and the like have been used\n     there may be no difficulty. Even without such words in\n     appropriate cases the maxim \"expressio unius est\n     exclusio alterius\" -- expression of one is the exclusion\n     of another -- may be applied. What is an appropriate\n     case shall depend on the facts of the case. In such a case\n     mention of one thing may imply exclusion of another.\n     When certain jurisdiction is specified in a contract an\n     intention to exclude all others from its operation may in\n     such cases be inferred. It has therefore to be properly\n     construed.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_50\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_51\">18. The said decision also referred to and relied upon an earlier\n\n  decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1548537/\" id=\"a_14\">Hakam Singh v. M/s. Gammon (India)\n\n  Ltd</a>. [1971 (1) SCC 286]. The said decision was rendered in the\n\n  light of facts of a similar contract where clause 12 of the tender\n\n  provided for arbitration whereas clause 13 provided;\n\n     \"Notwithstanding the place where the work under this\n     contract is to be executed, it is mutually understood and\n     agreed by and between the parties hereto that this\n     Contract shall be deemed to have been entered into by\n     the parties concerned in the city of Bombay and the court\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                            Page 13 of 23</span>\n\f      of law in the city of Bombay alone shall have jurisdiction\n      to adjudicate thereon.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_52\">\n\n      The question which fell for consideration of this Court in the\n\nsaid case was whether the Court at Bombay alone had jurisdiction\n\nover the dispute. In that context, it was held that the Code in its\n\nentirety applied to proceedings under the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_15\">Arbitration Act</a> by virtue of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/28932/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 41</a> of that Act and that the jurisdiction of the Court under the\n\nAct to entertain a proceeding for filing an Award was accordingly\n\ngoverned by the provisions of the Code. Reference was made to the\n\nprovisions of Section 20 of the Code, with all the terms of <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 20</a>\n\n</p><p id=\"p_53\">(a) of the Code read with explanation thereto, the respondent\n\nCompany which had its principal place of business at Bombay was\n\nliable to be sued at Bombay.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_54\">      It was further held that where two or more courts have\n\njurisdiction to try a suit or proceeding, an agreement between the\n\nparties that the dispute between them shall be tried in one of such\n\ncourts was not contrary to public policy and that such an agreement\n\ndid not contravene the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                               Page 14 of 23</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_55\">\f19. Similar view was also reiterated in <a href=\"/doc/518433/\" id=\"a_19\">Angile Insulations v. Davy\n\n   Ashmore India Ltd. and Another</a> [(1995) 4 SCC 153].\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_56\">20. <a href=\"/doc/1923755/\" id=\"a_20\">In Hanil Era Textiles Ltd. v. Puromatic Filters (P) Ltd</a>. [(2004)\n\n   4 SCC 671], it was held by this Court that where two or more\n\n   courts have jurisdiction under the Code, it is permissible to have\n\n   an agreement between the parties restricting the place of suing to\n\n   any one of them and if such restriction is placed in the agreement,\n\n   the same cannot be said to be contrary to public policy and does\n\n   not contravene <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act. It was however,\n\n   made clear that such restriction cannot be made and the parties\n\n   cannot by agreement confer jurisdiction on a court which\n\n   otherwise it does not possess under the Code.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_57\">      This Court also considered the scope of Section 20 of the Code\n\nin the said case and by referring to the said provision it was held that\n\nwhen ouster clause is clear, unambiguous and specific, accepted\n\nnotions of contract would bind parties and unless absence of ad idem\n\ncan be shown courts should avoid exercising jurisdiction.        While\n\narriving at the said finding this Court followed the ratio laid down in\n\nA.B.C. Laminart (P) Ltd. (supra).\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_58\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                             Page 15 of 23</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_59\">\f21.The aforesaid legal proposition settled by this Court in respect of\n\n   territorial jurisdiction and applicability of Section 20 of the Code\n\n   to <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_22\">Arbitration Act</a> is clear, unambiguous and explicit. The said\n\n   position is binding on both the parties who were contesting the\n\n   present proceeding. Both the parties with their open eyes entered\n\n   into the aforesaid purchase order and agreements thereon which\n\n   categorically provide that all disputes arising between the parties\n\n   out of the agreements would be adjudicated upon and decided\n\n   through the process of arbitration and that no court other than the\n\n   court at Jaipur shall have jurisdiction to entertain or try the same.\n\n   In both the agreements in clause 30 of General Conditions of the\n\n   Contract it was specifically mentioned that the contract shall for\n\n   all purposes be construed according to the laws of India and\n\n   subject to jurisdiction of only at Jaipur in Rajasthan Courts only\n\n   and in addition in one of the purchase order the expression used\n\n   was that the Court at Jaipur only would have jurisdiction to\n\n   entertain or try the same.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_60\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_61\">22.In the light of the aforesaid facts of the present case, the ratio of all\n\n   the aforesaid decisions which are referred to hereinbefore would\n\n   squarely govern and apply to the present case also.            There is\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                Page 16 of 23</span>\n\f  indeed an ouster clause used in the aforesaid stipulations stating\n\n  that the courts at Jaipur alone would have jurisdiction to try and\n\n  decide the said proceedings which could be initiated for\n\n  adjudication and deciding the disputes arising between the parties\n\n  with or in relation to the aforesaid agreements through the process\n\n  of arbitration. In other words, even though otherwise the Courts at\n\n  Calcutta would have territorial jurisdiction to try and decide such\n\n  disputes, but in view of the ouster clause it is only the courts at\n\n  Jaipur which would have jurisdiction to entertain such proceeding.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_62\">23.The Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court was aware of the\n\n  clauses and stipulations in the agreements and was also aware of\n\n  the abovementioned decisions of this Court, but the Division\n\n  Bench held that the said forum selection clause agreed to and\n\n  entered into between the parties would not apply in view of the\n\n  specific provision of <a href=\"/doc/1684349/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 31(4)</a> of the Act. The said provision\n\n  as well as sub-Section (3) are extracted below:-\n\n\n     \"31. Jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_63\">\n     (1).....................\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_64\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                Page 17 of 23</span>\n\f     (2).....................\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_65\">     (3) All applications regarding the conduct of arbitration\n     proceedings or otherwise arising out of such proceedings\n     shall be made to the Court where the award has been, or\n     may be, filed, and to no other Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_66\">     (4) Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in\n     this Act or in any other law for the time being in force,\n     where in any reference any application under this Act has\n     been made in a Court competent to entertain it, that\n     Court alone shall have jurisdiction over the arbitration\n     proceedings and all subsequent applications arising out\n     of that reference, and the arbitration proceedings shall be\n     made in that Court and in no other Court.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_67\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_68\">24.Having noticed the aforesaid provision of <a href=\"/doc/1684349/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 31(4)</a>, the\n\n  Division Bench held that since the aforesaid provision starts with a\n\n  non-obstantive clause, the said provisions would only apply and\n\n  would come into operation. The Division Bench finally held thus:\n\n\n     \"The said argument cannot be sustained after a plain\n     reading of <a href=\"/doc/1684349/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 31(4)</a> of the Act. It is clear from the\n     language used therein that where in any application has\n     been made in a court, competent to entertain, in that case\n     that court alone shall have jurisdiction. The requirement\n     is not that the application should be allowed. Since in\n     the instant case admittedly an application under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_26\">Section\n     20</a> has been made, which is an application in a reference,\n     Calcutta High Court will have jurisdiction.\"\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                Page 18 of 23</span>\n\f      The said findings were rendered by the Division Bench\n\nupsetting the findings of the learned Single Judge who had held that\n\nthe non-obstantive clause appearing in sub-Section (4) of <a href=\"/doc/1882318/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 31</a>\n\nwould not be attracted in the present case where the parties by an\n\nagreement had agreed to a particular forum having jurisdiction over\n\nthe dispute between the parties for adjudication.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_69\">25. Section 20 of the Code will apply in respect of deciding the issue\n\n   with regard to territorial jurisdiction of a court in respect of a\n\n   matter relating to arbitration also, for in Hakam Singh (supra), it\n\n   was held that the jurisdiction of the court under the Act to\n\n   entertain the proceeding for filing an Award was governed by the\n\n   provisions of the Code. We also at this stage may appropriately\n\n   refer to the definition of the word \"Court\" as appearing in <a href=\"/doc/105873/\" id=\"a_28\">Section\n\n   2(c)</a> of the Act wherein the expression \"Court\" is defined to mean\n\n   \"a Civil Court having jurisdiction to decide the questions forming\n\n   the subject matter of the reference if the same had been the subject\n\n   matter of a suit, but does not except for the purpose of arbitration\n\n   proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/157537/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 21</a>, include a Small Cause Court.\"\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                             Page 19 of 23</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_70\">\f26.Sub-section (3) precedes sub-Section (4) of <a href=\"/doc/1882318/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 31</a> of the Act.\n\n   The said sub-Section provides that all applications regarding the\n\n   conduct of arbitration proceedings or otherwise arising out of such\n\n   proceedings shall be made to the Court where the Award has been\n\n   or may be filed and to no other court. Sub-Section (4) on the other\n\n   hand states that where in any reference any application under the\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_31\">Arbitration Act</a> has been made in a Court competent to entertain,\n\n   then that Court alone would have jurisdiction over the arbitration\n\n   proceedings and all subsequent applications arising from that\n\n   matter and arbitration proceedings shall be made in that court and\n\n   in no other court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_71\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_72\">27.An analytical look at the provisions of sub-Sections (3) and (4)\n\n   will make it explicitly clear that any application in any reference,\n\n   meaning thereby even an application under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 20</a> of the Act\n\n   could or should be filed in a court competent to entertain such\n\n   proceeding and having jurisdiction to decide the subject of the\n\n   reference. Such jurisdiction would or could be restricted by the\n\n   agreements entered into by and between the parties. The parties\n\n   have clearly stipulated and agreed that no other court, but only the\n\n   court at Jaipur will have jurisdiction to try and decide the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                            Page 20 of 23</span>\n\f   proceedings arising out of the said agreements, and therefore, it is\n\n   the Civil Court at Jaipur which would alone have jurisdiction to\n\n   try and decide such issue and that is the court which is competent\n\n   to entertain such proceedings. The said court being competent to\n\n   entertain such proceedings, the said Court at Jaipur alone would\n\n   have jurisdiction over the arbitration proceedings and all\n\n   subsequent applications arising out of the reference. The\n\n   arbitration proceedings have to be made at Jaipur Court and in no\n\n   other court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_73\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_74\">28.In our considered opinion, the learned Division Bench of the\n\n   Calcutta High Court misread and misinterpreted the provisions of\n\n   sub-Sections (3) and (4) of <a href=\"/doc/1882318/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 31</a> of the Act and thereby\n\n   arrived at a wrong finding to the effect that by virtue of the\n\n   aforesaid provision of <a href=\"/doc/1611649/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 31(4)</a> the Calcutta High Court\n\n   would have jurisdiction in the matter.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_75\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_76\">29.In view of the aforesaid findings and conclusions arrived at by us\n\n   holding that it is only the Court at Jaipur which will have\n\n   jurisdiction to try and decide the arbitration proceedings between\n\n   the parties and also entertain a petition of the aforesaid nature i.e.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                             Page 21 of 23</span>\n\f   <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 20</a> of the Act, we set aside and quash the judgment and\n\n   order of the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court.

Subsequently,\nthe writ petition was withdrawn.\n</p><p id=\"p_3\">             During the pendency of the writ petition, and before it was withdrawn,\nan interim order had been passed by the High Court staying the grant of licences. A\ncontempt petition was filed before the High Court alleging that licences were granted\nin violation of the stay order of the High Court, but that contempt petition was\ndismissed.   Against that order dismissing the contempt petition, a special leave\npetition was filed in this Court which was decided by this Court in the judgment\nreported as <a href=\"/doc/182170/\" id=\"a_2\">All Bengal Licensees Association v. Raghabendra Singh &amp; Ors</a>. [2007 (11)\nSCC 374.\n</p><p id=\"p_4\">             In that contempt petition, the Court accepted the apology of the alleged\ncontemnors, but having done so, in paragraph 40 of the judgment it directed\ncancellation of the licences for the auctions held on 20.03.2005, 21.03.2005 and\n22.03.2005 and directed that their businesses shall be stopped forthwith.\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">             The aforesaid direction in paragraph 40 of the judgment was passed\nwithout hearing the persons whose licences were ordered to be cancelled. In fact even\nthe impleadment applications of such persons were rejected.\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">             It is a basic principle of justice that no adverse orders should be passed\nagainst a party without hearing him. This is the fundamental principle of natural\njustice and it is a basic canon of jurisprudence.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                     -3-</span>\n<p id=\"p_7\">            In the Seven Judge Constitution Bench of this Court, <a href=\"/doc/1353689/\" id=\"a_3\">A.R.

It is true that in\nparagraph 9 of the said judgment it has been observed that this Court under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_5\">Article\n32</a> of the Constitution cannot hold as invalid a judgment of this Court by treating it as\na nullity. However, the aforesaid judgment does not say that we cannot pass a recall\norder when that order has been passed without hearing a party.\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">            There is a distinction between a petition under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 32</a>, a review\npetition and a recall petition. While in a review petition the Court considers on merits\nwhere there is an error apparent on the face of the record, in a recall petition the\nCourt does not go into the merits but simply recalls an order which was passed\nwithout giving an opportunity of hearing to an affected party. We are treating this\npetition under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 32</a> as a recall petition because the order passed in the decision\nin <a href=\"/doc/182170/\" id=\"a_8\">All Bengal Licensees Association v.

RESPONDENTS\n\n\n\n                                 O R D E R\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"p_1\">R. V. Raveendran J.,\n\n\n\n       Mrs.   Amita     Gupta,        learned     counsel,     appears       for\n\nrespondents and waives notice.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_2\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_3\">2.     The petitioner filed a suit for specific performance\n\nof an alleged agreement of sale dated 15.7.2003. The trial\n\ncourt    dismissed     the    suit     by   judgment     and   decree     dated\n\n19.5.2008. The High Court dismissed the petitioner's appeal\n\non    29.9.2008.    Both     courts    held     that   petitioner     had    not\n\napproached    the     court    with    clean     hands   and   that     he   had\n\nfailed to prove any concluded contract for sale. High Court\n\nfound that the defendants in the suit were also not above\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                         2</span>\n\nboard    in    their   conduct.      It       found   that     both    sides    were\n\nguilty    of     having      lied    on       oath    and      deserved    to    be\n\nprosecuted. On the ground that courts were over-burdened\n\nwith litigation, the High Court decided that instead of\n\ndirecting prosecution, heavy costs should be levied on both\n\npetitioner and respondents \"to be paid to the state which\n\nspends money on providing the judicial infrastructure.\" It\n\nthen proceeded to impose exemplary costs of Rs.1,00,000/-\n\non the petitioner and Rs.1,00,000/- on the respondents, and\n\ndirected that the costs should be deposited with the Delhi\n\nHigh Court Legal Services Committee.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">3.    Feeling aggrieved by the dismissal of his appeal, the\n\npetitioner is before this Court. On merits, we find that\n\nthe concurrent findings of the trial court and the High\n\nCourt do not warrant interference and therefore this is not\n\na fit case for grant of leave.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">4.    The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that\n\nlevying costs of Rupees one lakh against the petitioner was\n\nnot warranted. He submitted that as the appeal before the\n\nHigh Court arose out of a civil suit, costs were governed\n\nby   section     35    and   35A    of       the   Code   of   Civil    Procedure\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                           3</span>\n\n(`Code' for short) and cannot exceed what is leviable under\n\nthose provisions.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">5.    Under    section         35    of    the       Code,   award     of    costs   is\n\ndiscretionary but subject to the conditions and limitations\n\nas may be prescribed and the provisions of any law for the\n\ntime being in force. Under section 35A, compensatory costs\n\nfor   vexatious          claims     and        defences      may     not    exceed   to\n\nRs.3,000/-.    Further         the    primary         object    of    levying    costs\n\nunder sections 35 and 35A CPC, is to recompense a litigant\n\nfor the expense incurred by him in litigation to vindicate\n\nor defend his right. It is therefore payable by a losing\n\nlitigant to his successful opponent. When an appellant or a\n\nplaintiff     has    already        paid       the    prescribed      court    fee   in\n\nregard to the appeal or suit, to the state at the time of\n\ninstitution,        it    is   debatable          whether      any    costs    can   be\n\nawarded to the state by way of penalty, in a litigation\n\nbetween two private parties. Courts will have to act with\n\ncare while opening new frontiers.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">6.    One view has been that the provisions of sections 35\n\nand 35A CPC do not in any way affect the wide discretion\n\nvested in by High Court in exercise of its inherent power\n\nto award costs in the interests of justice in appropriate\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                      4</span>\n\ncivil cases. The more sound view however is that though\n\naward of costs is within the discretion of the court, it is\n\nsubject    to    such       conditions    and   limitations    as   may    be\n\nprescribed and subject to the provisions of any law for the\n\ntime being in force; and where the issue is governed and\n\nregulated by sections 35 and 35A of the Code, there is no\n\nquestion    of    exercising       inherent     power    contrary   to    the\n\nspecific provisions of the Code. Further, the provisions of\n\nsection 35A seems to suggest that even where a suit or\n\nlitigation is vexatious, the outer limit of exemplary costs\n\nthat can be awarded, in addition to regular costs, shall\n\nnot exceed Rs.3000/-. It is also to be noted that huge\n\ncosts of the order of Rs. Fifty thousand or Rs.One lakh,\n\nare normally awarded only in writ proceedings and public\n\ninterest litigations, and not in civil litigation to which\n\nsections   35    and    35A     are   applicable.   The    principles     and\n\npractices relating to levy of costs in administrative law\n\nmatters    cannot      be    imported     mechanically    in   relation   to\n\ncivil litigation governed by the Code.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">7.   The present system of levying meagre costs in civil\n\nmatters (or no costs in some matters), no doubt, is wholly\n\nunsatisfactory and does not act as a deterrent to vexatious\n\nor luxury litigation borne out of ego or greed, or resorted\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                         5</span>\n\nto   as     a    `buying-time'       tactic.       More       realistic        approach\n\nrelating to costs may be the need of the hour. Whether we\n\nshould      adopt      suitably,     the     western         models       of   awarding\n\nactual and more realistic costs is a matter that requires\n\nto be debated and should engage the urgent attention of the\n\nLaw Commission of India.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">8.     We do not however propose to examine or decide the\n\nabove issues here, except to observe that courts should not\n\nexceed or overlook the limitations placed by the Code with\n\nreference to costs in civil litigation. In so far this case\n\nis concerned, even though the order relating to costs may\n\nnot strictly be correct, we do not propose to interfere\n\nwith      the    same,      in   exercise     of       our    jurisdiction          under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_1\">Article         136</a>,   as    the   order         has    not    resulted        in     any\n\ninjustice. It is stated that the respondents have already\n\ndeposited the costs. The time for deposit of costs by the\n\npetitioner        is   extended     at     his    request      by     a    month    from\n\ntoday.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">9.     We would however like to refer to two aspects of the\n\norder of the High Court relating to costs. The first is,\n\nwhether a court, having reached a conclusion that a party\n\ndeserves to be prosecuted for perjury, should let him off\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                         6</span>\n\nwith what it considers to be a stiff penalty by way of\n\ncosts,    on    the     ground    that       courts       are    overburdened        with\n\nwork.    We     propose    to     leave      open       for     the    present,      this\n\nquestion involving moral and ethical issues.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">10.   The      second    aspect    relates         to     the    recipient      of    the\n\ncosts. In para 38 of the impugned judgment, the High Court\n\nspecifically       stated       that    it     had      decided       to   saddle     the\n\nparties with heavy costs to be paid to the state which\n\nspends money on judicial infrastructure. Having said so, in\n\npara 39, the High Court directed that the costs should be\n\npaid to the Delhi High Court Legal Services Committee. The\n\nHigh Court Legal Services Committee, a statutory authority\n\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/26738839/\" id=\"a_2\">Legal Services Authorities Act</a>, 1987, is not the\n\n`state'        that      spends        money         on       providing       judicial\n\ninfrastructure,         referred       in    the     earlier          para.   Once   the\n\nCourt held that costs had to be paid to the state, it\n\nshould have directed payment of the costs to the state and\n\nnot the High Court Legal Services Committee. No litigant\n\nshould be made to feel that heavy costs are being levied in\n\nsome cases by Judges to create a corpus or expense fund for\n\nthe High Court Legal Services Committee or the State Legal\n\nServices Authority. While levy of an uniform token sum, as\n\ncosts payable to the Legal Service Authority/Committee by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                        7</span>\n\nway of a deterrent fine, in regard to non-compliance with\n\nprocedural      requirements,           delays       in    re-presentation        of\n\npapers etc. may not be objectionable, levy of huge amounts\n\nas    costs   in    selected       cases,     made    payable      to    the   Legal\n\nService Authorities, may invite adverse comments and evoke\n\nhostility to legal services in general. We have also come\n\nacross cases of costs being levied and made payable to some\n\nnon-party      charitable         organizations.          Levy   of     such   costs\n\nshould be avoided.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_19\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">11.    The Delhi High Court Legal Services Committee when it\n\nreceives      the   sum     of    Rs.   Two    Lakhs       as    costs    from   the\n\nparties, shall make over the same to the state government\n\nas directed in para 38 of the impugned judgment.

The issue which arises for consideration in this appeal is\n\nwhether the post of Boiler Overhauling Mechanic is equivalent to that\n\nof the post of Boiler Mistry or Fitter so as to enable the workman,\n\nrespondent herein to draw higher pay scale than what is being given\n\nto him. There is no dispute with regard to the fact that the post of\n\nBoiler Overhauling Mechanic is a different post than that of the post of\n\nBoiler Mistry which is equivalent to that of Fitter in `Skilled - A'\n\nCategory.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                                                  2</span><p id=\"p_5\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">3.      The workman, respondent herein was appointed as coolie in the\n\nservice of the appellant Board with effect from 1.4.1969 in the pay\n\nscale of Rs. 55-90. He was thereafter designated as Helper in the\n\nsame pay scale of coolie and worked in the said post till 13.9.1977.\n\nThereafter he appeared before the Selection Committee No. 2 for\n\nbeing promoted to the post of Boiler Overhauling Mechanic. In the\n\nsaid selection, by order dated 13.9.1977 the respondent was declared\n\nsuccessful consequent upon which he was offered the post of Boiler\n\nOverhauling Mechanic in the then pay scale of Rs. 80-145. The\n\naforesaid pay scale, however, has been revised with the passage of\n\ntime.     He joined the duties of Boiler Overhauling Mechanic on\n\n14.9.1977 and since then he performed his duties accordingly. It is\n\nstated that he was also looking after the work of Fitter in addition to\n\nthe work of Boiler Overhauling Mechanic. In terms of the policy his\n\nemployment in the Board was confirmed as against the post of coolie\n\nwith effect from 1.4.1976 under order issued by the competent\n\nauthority on 14.9.1978.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">4.      The allegation was that one Shri Jogeshwar Prasad, who was\n\nworking at Sohawal Power House, Faizabad as Boiler Mistry was\n\ngiven the status of `Skilled-A' worker and was given the pay scale of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                                                    3</span>\n\nRs. 150-285 with effect from 1.4.1969.       The respondent-workman\n\nclaimed that the same pay scale which has been given to Jogeshwar\n\nPrasad should also be given to him. In terms thereof he raised an\n\nindustrial dispute contending inter alia that since the work of Boiler\n\nOverhauling Mechanic and Boiler Mistry are identical and the nature\n\nand responsibilities are also similar, he is entitled to get the same pay\n\nscale on the principle of equal pay for equal work. He claimed that his\n\npay should be fixed in the pay scale of Rs. 150-285 with effect from\n\n1.4.1977, as revised from time to time.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">5.   The aforesaid industrial dispute raised by the Union on behalf of\n\nthe respondent-workman was referred to the Tribunal for adjudication\n\nunder the following terms:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">       \"Whether the employers should give pay scale of Skilled\n       Category -A to Shri Aziz Ahmad, son of Shri Rashid\n       Mohammad, Boiler Overhauling Mechanic? If yes, then\n       from which date and with what other details?\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_11\">6.   The Tribunal, on receipt of the aforesaid reference, issued\n\nnotices to the parties upon which the parties appeared and filed their\n\nrespective pleadings. The evidence was also led by the parties by\n\nproducing witnesses in support of their case.       The Tribunal, after\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                                                    4</span>\n\nhearing the parties, passed an award on 17.2.1999 holding that the\n\nwork being done by the workman Aziz Ahmad as Boiler Overhauling\n\nMechanic is the same as the work of Fitter and that the pay scale of\n\nthe posts of Boiler Mistry and the fitter was Rs. 150-285 and that on\n\nthe settled principle of equal pay for equal work, workman Aziz Ahmad\n\nis entitled to the same pay scale as that of the Fitter. The Tribunal\n\nheld that the said workman Aziz Ahmad would be entitled to the pay\n\nscale of `Skilled-A' category as admissible to Fitter with effect from\n\n14.9.1977, but however, as he appeared before the Conciliation Board\n\nin 1989, it was held that he would be entitled to the benefit of the\n\naforesaid pay scale only with effect from 1.1.1989.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">7.    Being aggrieved by the aforesaid award passed by the Industrial\n\nTribunal, the appellant Board preferred a writ petition in the High Court\n\nof Allahabad which was entertained and was heard on merit. The\n\nlearned Single Judge by his judgment and order dated 27.10.2005\n\ndismissed the writ petition holding that no interference was called for.\n\nIt was held by the learned Single Judge that the Tribunal rightly came\n\nto the conclusion that the workman had actually worked as Boiler\n\nMistry and had discharged superior functions of the post which was\n\nequal to that of Fitter.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                                                   5</span><p id=\"p_13\">\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">8.    The appellant being aggrieved by the order passed by the\n\nlearned Single Judge and award passed by the Tribunal filed the\n\npresent appeal on which notice and stay order were issued.\n\nConsequent thereupon this appeal was listed for hearing.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">9.    Mr. Pradeep Misra, learned counsel appearing for the appellant\n\nBoard submitted before us that the respondent-workman was made\n\naware of his status and position through the appointment letter issued\n\nto him making it clear that he had been appointed to the post of Boiler\n\nOverhauling Mechanic in the pay scale of Rs. 80-145 which he\n\naccepted and had also received all the benefits on the basis of the\n\nsaid pay scale. It was submitted that having accepted the aforesaid\n\nposition the respondent cannot turn back and claim for change in his\n\npay scale on the ground of equal pay for equal work. It was also\n\nsubmitted by him that the duties and responsibilities attached to the\n\npost of Fitter or Boiler Mistry are much more higher than that of the\n\nduties and responsibilities attached to the post of Boiler Overhauling\n\nMechanic, and therefore, the Tribunal as also the learned Single\n\nJudge were not justified in holding that the duties and responsibilities\n\nof the aforesaid posts are similar.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                                                        6</span><p id=\"p_16\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">      It was further submitted that there is no evidence or material\n\nplaced on record to substantiate that duties and responsibilities\n\nattached with the post of Fitter or Boiler Mistry are similar and identical\n\nin all respects to that of the duties and responsibilities attached to the\n\npost of Boiler Overhauling Mechanic and in absence of clear evidence\n\nin that regard it was inappropriate on the part of both the learned\n\nSingle Judge of the High Court as also of the learned Industrial\n\nTribunal to pass an award in favour of the workman.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">10.   Mr.   A.P.   Mohanty,    learned    counsel    appearing    for   the\n\nrespondent-workman, however, sought to justify both the award as\n\nalso the judgment and order of the learned Single Judge upholding the\n\naward contending inter alia that from the pleadings of the parties and\n\ndepositions recorded by the Labour Court, if it is possible to come to\n\nthe conclusion that both the posts carry the same duties and\n\nresponsibilities or identical responsibilities and status, then the\n\nTribunal could have and accordingly has rightly passed the award in\n\nfavour of the workman.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_19\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">11.   In order to appreciate the aforesaid contentions we have\n\ncarefully scrutinised the records including the documents and the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                                                     7</span>\n\ndepositions. We have carefully analysed the findings recorded by the\n\nTribunal in paragraph 12 of the award.       In the said paragraph the\n\nTribunal recorded that the issue to be determined is whether the\n\nworkman Aziz Ahmad is doing similar work as that of the work of Fitter\n\nor Boiler Mistry.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_21\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">12.   Having framed the aforesaid issue for consideration, the\n\nTribunal immediately went on to record a finding that it was\n\nunfortunate that none of the parties had filed an objective data with\n\nregard to the work assessment of the aforesaid posts. The learned\n\nTribunal put the burden on the employer to record the job\n\nrequirements of the aforesaid posts and to prove and establish that\n\nthey are not identical. The aforesaid findings of the learned Tribunal\n\nwere also upheld by the learned Single Judge.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_23\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_24\">13.   In our considered opinion the aforesaid findings are incorrect\n\n      and cannot be upheld. The burden to prove a particular fact is\n\n      always on the person who alleges the same. In the present\n\n      case it was the contention of the respondent-workman, who\n\n      claimed that the job requirements, nature and responsibilities of\n\n      the post of Boiler Mistry/Fitter are identical and similar with that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                                                     8</span>\n\n      of the Boiler Overhauling Mechanic. The burden, therefore, was\n\n      on the workman to prove and establish the aforesaid facts by\n\n      leading cogent and reliable evidence. He was required to place\n\n      documentary evidence in support of the same.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_25\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_26\">14.   The principle that the burden of proof is on a person who alleges\n\n      it has been reiterated by this Court innumerable times. For\n\n      reference we may extract the following passages from the\n\n      judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1176691/\" id=\"a_1\">State of M.P. v. Pramod Bhartiya</a>,\n\n      [(1993) 1 SCC 539]:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_27\">      \"13...............It must be remembered that since the plea\n      of equal pay for equal work has to be examined with\n      reference to <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 14</a>, the burden is upon the petitioners\n      to establish their right to equal pay, or the plea of\n      discrimination, as the case may be. This burden the\n      original petitioners (respondents herein) have failed to\n      discharge.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_28\">\n\nFurther in <a href=\"/doc/734107/\" id=\"a_3\">Union of India v. Tarit Ranjan Da</a> [(2003) 11 SCC 658]\n\nwherein one of us (Dr. Arijit Pasayat) was a member this Court held:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      \"9................ Further, the Tribunal and the High Court\n      proceeded as if it was the employer who was to show that\n      there was no equality in the work. On the contrary, the\n      person who asserts that there is equality has to prove it.\n      The equality is not based on designation or the nature of\n      work alone.

The Tribunal as also the High Court while affirming the award\n\n      changed the rule of the game by placing the entire burden of\n\n      proof on the management that the posts are not identical.\n\n      Whether the aforesaid posts are identical and whether the\n\n      persons holding the post of Boiler Overhauling Mechanic, Boiler\n\n      Mistry or Fitter are doing identical or similar nature of work and\n\n      discharge the same functions and responsibilities are required to\n\n      be adjudicated upon and decided by making an analysis of their\n\n      nature of duties, responsibilities, pay scales and other factors\n\n      which are required to be considered for deciding such an issue.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                                                   10</span>\n\nThis Court in a number of decisions has laid down the guiding\n\nfactors and principles as to how the issue with regard to\n\nequation of posts is to be considered and analyzed. In Secy.,\n\nFinance Deptt. v. W.B. Registration Service Assn., 1993\n\n[Supp (1) SCC 153] this Court enumerated the factors to be\n\ntaken into consideration for job evaluation:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_31\">\n\"12. We do not consider it necessary to traverse the case\nlaw on which reliance has been placed by counsel for the\nappellants as it is well settled that equation of posts and\ndetermination of pay scales is the primary function of the\nexecutive and not the judiciary and, therefore, ordinarily\ncourts will not enter upon the task of job evaluation which is\ngenerally left to expert bodies like the Pay Commissions,\netc. But that is not to say that the Court has no jurisdiction\nand the aggrieved employees have no remedy if they are\nunjustly treated by arbitrary State action or inaction. Courts\nmust, however, realise that job evaluation is both a difficult\nand time consuming task which even expert bodies having\nthe assistance of staff with requisite expertise have found\ndifficult to undertake sometimes on account of want of\nrelevant data and scales for evaluating performances of\ndifferent groups of employees. This would call for a\nconstant study of the external comparisons and internal\nrelativities on account of the changing nature of job\nrequirements. The factors which may have to be kept in\nview for job evaluation may include (i) the work programme\nof his department (ii) the nature of contribution expected of\nhim (iii) the extent of his responsibility and accountability in\nthe discharge of his diverse duties and functions (iv) the\nextent and nature of freedoms/limitations available or\nimposed on him in the discharge of his duties (v) the extent\nof powers vested in him (vi) the extent of his dependence\non superiors for the exercise of his powers (vii) the need to\nco-ordinate with other departments, etc. We have also\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                                                        11</span>\n\nreferred to the history of the service and the effort of\nvarious bodies to reduce the total number of pay scales to\na reasonable number. Such reduction in the number of pay\nscales has to be achieved by resorting to broadbanding of\nposts by placing different posts having comparable job\ncharts in a common scale. Substantial reduction in the\nnumber of pay scales must inevitably lead to clubbing of\nposts and grades which were earlier different and unequal.\nWhile doing so care must be taken to ensure that such\nrationalisation of the pay structure does not throw up\nanomalies. Ordinarily a pay structure is evolved keeping in\nmind several factors, e.g., (i) method of recruitment, (ii)\nlevel at which recruitment is made, (iii) the hierarchy of\nservice in a given cadre, (iv) minimum educational/technical\nqualifications required, (v) avenues of promotion, (vi) the\nnature of duties and responsibilities, (vii) the horizontal and\nvertical relativities with similar jobs, (viii) public dealings, (ix)\nsatisfaction level, (x) employer's capacity to pay, etc. We\nhave referred to these matters in some detail only to\nemphasise that several factors have to be kept in view\nwhile evolving a pay structure and the horizontal and\nvertical relativities have to be carefully balanced keeping in\nmind the hierarchical arrangements, avenues for\npromotion, etc. Such a carefully evolved pay structure\nought not to be ordinarily disturbed as it may upset the\nbalance and cause avoidable ripples in other cadres as\nwell. It is presumably for this reason that the Judicial\nSecretary who had strongly recommended a substantial\nhike in the salary of the Sub-Registrars to the Second\n(State) Pay Commission found it difficult to concede the\ndemand made by the Registration Service before him in his\ncapacity as the Chairman of the Third (State) Pay\nCommission. There can, therefore, be no doubt that\nequation of posts and equation of salaries is a complex\nmatter which is best left to an expert body unless there is\ncogent material on record to come to a firm conclusion that\na grave error had crept in while fixing the pay scale for a\ngiven post and Court's interference is absolutely necessary\nto undo the injustice.\"\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                                                      12</span><p id=\"p_32\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_33\">16.   Moreover in <a href=\"/doc/1246624/\" id=\"a_5\">Gyan Prakash v. Union of India</a> [(1997) 11 SCC\n\n      670] it was held that application of the principle of equal pay for\n\n      equal work cannot be claimed merely because there was\n\n      delegation of certain powers. The ratio of the aforesaid decision\n\n      is applicable to the facts of the present case as the claim of the\n\n      Respondent for a higher pay scale is also on the ground that he\n\n      was discharging the duties of a higher post also, without\n\n      however, giving any factual details in that regard.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_34\">17.   Being conscious of the aforesaid legal position we are of the\n\n      considered    opinion   that   the   learned   Industrial   Tribunal\n\n      committed a manifest error of law and of fact initially by placing\n\n      the burden on the employer to prove and establish the job\n\n      requirements of the said three posts, and thereafter, again\n\n      committed an error in coming to the conclusion that the posts\n\n      are identical on the basis of the pleadings of the parties alone.\n\n      Pleadings are required to be proved and so long evidence is not\n\n      led in support of the pleadings no reliance can be placed only on\n\n      the pleadings without there being any cogent evidence in\n\n      support of the pleadings. Pleadings are required to be proved\n\n      by leading evidence.      The Tribunal expressly stated in its\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                                                   13</span>\n\n      findings that none of the parties have filed any objective data in\n\n      regard to the work assessment of the posts of Boiler\n\n      Overhauling Mechanic, Boiler Mistry or Fitter.     In absence of\n\n      such evidence the Tribunal was not justified in coming to a\n\n      conclusion that the nature, duties and responsibilities of the\n\n      three posts are identical and similar.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_35\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_36\">18.   Therefore, we have no other option but to remand this matter to\n\n      the Industrial Tribunal for fresh adjudication in accordance with\n\n      law.   We, however, allow the parties an opportunity to lead\n\n      further evidence in support of their claims and counter claims\n\n      regarding the status and position of the aforesaid three posts.\n\n      The Tribunal should see to it that the claims and the rebuttal of\n\n      the said claim should be supported by cogent and reliable\n\n      evidence.     For that matter the Tribunal shall render an\n\n      opportunity to the parties to lead their evidence in support of\n\n      their case and on the basis of the records, as available, the\n\n      Tribunal would decide afresh the issue whether the nature,\n\n      duties and responsibilities of the said three posts are identical,\n\n      and thereafter, the Tribunal should answer the reference.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                                                           14</span>\n\n</p><p id=\"p_37\">19.   Consequently, we set aside both the award passed by the\n\n      Tribunal as also the judgment passed by the learned Single\n\n      Judge and remit back the matter to the Industrial Tribunal for\n\n      decision in terms of the aforesaid observations. It is needless to\n\n      say that since it is an old matter, the Tribunal should render a\n\n      priority in hearing of this matter and would make all endeavour to\n\n      decide the matter, preferably within a period of six months.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_38\">20.

Thandrapadu villages for the\n\npurpose of establishing a Post Graduation Centre of Sri Krishna Devaraya\n\nUniversity.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">4.    Out of the said 87 Acres 96 cents of land, we are concerned only with\n\n25 acres of land of which respondents were owners. The Land Acquisition\n\nOfficer made an award on or about 20.12.1995 fixing the market value of\n\nthe lands at the rate of Rs.15,000/- per acre for the lands situated in B.\n\nThandrapadu village and Rs.16,000/- per acre for the lands situated in\n\nPasupula village.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">5.    Dissatisfied with the quantum of compensation awarded by the Land\n\nAcquisition Officer, the respondents sought for reference from the Collector\n\nbefore the Civil Court in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1517117/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 18</a> of the said Act.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">      The learned Principal Senior Civil Judge, Kurnool by a judgment and\n\naward dated 28.03.2001 enhanced the market value thereof from\n\nRs.15,000/- to Rs.90,000/- per acre for the lands situated in B.

Appeals and cross-objections were filed thereagainst\n\nby the parties hereto.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">6.    By reason of judgments and orders dated 18.3.2002 and 28.3.2003, a\n\nDivision Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court enhanced the market\n\nvalue of the land to Rs.1,90,000/- per acre uniformly for the lands situated\n\nin both the villages.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">7.    Parties thereto are, thus, before us.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_17\">\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">8.    The High Court in support of its judgment, inter alia, relied upon a\n\nregistered deed of sale dated 12.11.1987, which was marked as Exhibit B-3\n\nwhereby and whereunder four cents of land was sold for a sum of\n\nRs.10,000/-. On that premise, it was contended that the value of the land\n\nper acre would be Rs.2,50,000/-. The High Court furthermore relied on its\n\nearlier judgment and order passed in A.S. No. 1095 of 1996 (Exhibit B-6)\n\nwherein market value of the lands acquired therein was fixed at the rate of\n\nRs.2,70,000/- per acre.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_19\">\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">      In respect of the land covered by Exhibit B-6, a notification under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/169774/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 4(1)</a> of the Act was issued on 30.06.1992 for the purpose of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                   4</span>\n\nestablishing Bharat Gas Power Station. It was noticed that the lands which\n\nwere acquired for the said Bharat Gas Power Station being situated at a\n\ndistance of about 8 kilometers from Kurnool Town whereas the acquired\n\nlands were situated about 4-5 kilometers away from Kurnool Town.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">      It was stated:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_22\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">            \"As can be seen from Ex.B6, this court has fixed\n            the rate of compensation at Rs.2,70,000/- and the\n            notification was issued in June 1992 whereas in\n            the present cases notification was issued in May\n            1995. In such an event, if escalation is given at\n            10% on the value fixed by this Court, it would be\n            around Rs.3,24,000/- per acre. Let us test the\n            value from the other angle. Ex. B3 is a small\n            extent of 4 cents and the purchase took place in\n            the year 1997. The reference court correctly\n            observed that as the purchase was made about 7\n            years earlier to the notification, the purchase was\n            not made with a view to have an undue advantage\n            of higher compensation. As per Ex. B3 the value\n            per acre is Rs.4,00,000/- if 10% escalation is given\n            for 7 years, the same comes to Rs.6,80,000/- and\n            even if we take 60% of the amount by keeping in\n            view the small extent sold under Ex.B3 and also\n            giving discount for developmental activities, it\n            would be Rs.2,72,000/- per acre. Therefore, we\n            follow the safest method for arriving at the\n            compensation with reference to Ex.B6 which is in\n            an extent of 27 and the area covered by the batch\n            of appeals is also almost same, and the notification\n            was issued for 87.96 cents, granting of escalation\n            by deduction 40% of the amount and fixing the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                  5</span>\n\n            compensation at Rs.1,90,000/- would be just and\n            reasonable. Therefore, we have taken the course\n            of resorting to 40% of the amount as the land\n            acquired was for the University Buildings,\n            wherein internal roads have to be laid and other\n            open spaces have to be left out. Thus, keeping in\n            view the above facts, we feel that granting\n            compensation at Rs.1,90,000/- is just and\n            reasonable.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p_23\">9.    Mr. R. Sundarvardhan, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of\n\nappellant would contend:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_24\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      i.    As this Court in Civil Appeal No. 5206-5228 of 1997 (A.P.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">            Industrial Infrastructure Corporation Limited vs. G. Mohan\n\n            Reddy &amp; ors.) interfered with the judgment and order passed in\n\n            A.S. No. 1095 of 1996 and batch to hold that the market value\n\n            of the land in question should be fixed at Rs.1,35,000/-,\n\n            Rs.90,000/- and Rs.70,000/- per acre for different survey nos.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">            on the premise that the situation of the land keeping in view\n\n            their distance from the National Highway play a vital role as\n\n            the land which is near the Highway would definitely get a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                   6</span>\n\n            higher price than the land which is away therefrom, the\n\n            impugned judgment cannot be sustained.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      ii.   Exhibit B-3 being the registered sale deed dated 12.11.1987\n\n            could not have been relied upon as only 4 cents of land was the\n\n            subject matter of transfer in terms thereof whereas the\n\n            notification had been issued for acquisition of land measuring\n\n            87 Acres 96 cents.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"p_25\">10.   Mrs. K. Amareswari, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of\n\nthe respondents, on the other hand, would contend:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      i.    It is not correct to contend that an exemplar in terms whereof\n\n            only a small portion of land had been transferred can never be\n\n            taken into consideration.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">      ii.   Keeping in view the fact that the market rate in terms of\n\n            Exhibit B-3 would come to Rs.2,50,000/- per acre, even if 50\n\n            per cent is deducted therefrom, the market value may be\n\n            determined at Rs.1,25,000/- to which increase therein at the\n\n            rate of 10 per cent per year should be added and as the lands in\n\n            question were acquired on 5.5.1994, that is, 7 years after the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                    7</span>\n\n             said deed of sale was executed, the market value thereof would\n\n             come to Rs.2,12,500/- per acre.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">      iii.   So far as the judgment of this Court passed in Civil Appeal No.\n\n             5206-5228 of 1997 (A.P. Industrial Infrastructure Corporation\n\n             Limited vs. G. Mohan Reddy &amp; ors.) is concerned, the\n\n             notification therein having been issued on or about 30.6.1992\n\n             whereas the notification in the instant case having been\n\n             published on 5.5.1994, no reliance can be placed thereupon as\n\n             admittedly the lands were situated 8 kilometers away from the\n\n             National Highway whereas the lands in question are situated\n\n             only 4 kilometers away from the Highway.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"p_26\">11.   Determination of market value of a land acquired in terms of the\n\nprovisions of the said Act depends upon a large number of factors; the first\n\nbeing the nature and quality of the land, i.e., whether agricultural land or\n\nhomestead land. Apart from nature and quality of land in the event the\n\nagricultural lands are acquired the other factors relevant therefor are also\n\nrequired to be considered, namely, as to whether they are irrigated or non-\n\nirrigated, extent of facilities available for irrigation, location of the land,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                    8</span>\n\ncloseness thereof from any road or highway, the evenness of land, its\n\nposition in different seasons particularly in rainy season, existence of any\n\nbuilding or structure as also the development in and around the area. A host\n\nof other factors will also have a bearing on determining the valuation of\n\nland.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_27\">\n</p><p id=\"p_28\">12.     The mode and manner in which determination of such valuation are to\n\nbe carried out would also depend upon the facts and circumstances of each\n\ncase, namely, whether any deed of sale executed in respect of similarly\n\nsituated land near about the date of issuance of notification under <a href=\"/doc/43654/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 4</a>\n\n(1) of the Act is available, or in absence of any such exemplars whether the\n\nclaim can be determined on yield basis or in case of an orchard on the basis\n\nof the number of fruit bearing trees and the yield therefrom.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_29\">13.     One other important factor which also should be borne in mind is that\n\nit may not be safe to rely only on an award involving a neighbouring area\n\nirrespective of the nature and quality of the land. For determination of\n\nmarket value again, the positive and negative factors germane therefor\n\nshould be taken into consideration, as laid down by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1500467/\" id=\"a_5\">Viluben\n\nJhalejar Contractor vs. State of Gujarat</a> [(2005) 4 SCC 789], namely:\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                    9</span>\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">           Positive factors                        Negative factors\n\n(i)    Smallness of size                (i)    Largeness of area\n\n(ii)   proximity to a road              (ii)   situation in the interior at a\n                                               distance from the road\n\n(iii) frontage on a road                (iii   narrow strip of land with very\n                                        )      small frontage compared to\n                                               depth\n\n(iv)   Nearness to developed area       (iv) lower level requiring the\n                                             depressed portion to be filled\n                                             up\n\n(v)    regular shape                    (v)    Remoteness from developed\n                                               locality\n\n</pre><p id=\"p_30\">(vi)   Level vis-`-vis land under (vi) Some special disadvantageous\n       acquisition                     factors which would deter a\n                                       purchaser\n\n(vii   Special value for an owner of\n)      an adjoining property to\n       whom it may have some very\n       special advantage.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_31\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_32\">14.    Before determination of the market value of the land, we may notice\n\nthat the town of Kurnool is the District Headquarter of Kurnool district.\n\nThe acquired lands are situated about 4 kilometers away from the said town\n\nabutting National Highway No. 18. The lands in question have been held to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                   10</span>\n\nhave the requisite potential value as building site as also for constructing\n\nindustrial complexes. The learned Reference Judge noticed that there are\n\neducational institutions like Pulla Reddy Engineering College, Don Bosco\n\nSchool, St. Mary's Residential School etc. surrounding the acquired lands.\n\nG. Pulla Reddy Engineering College is said to be situated just on the other\n\nside of the road of the lands acquired. As on the date of acquisition, it was\n\nfound that the vicinity surrounding the land was well developed.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_33\">15.   Indisputably, a big chunk of lands, namely, 87 Acres 96 cents were\n\nacquired for the purpose of establishing an institution known as Sri Krishna\n\nDevaraya University. The award of the Land Acquisition Collector was\n\naccepted by most of the persons. Only the respondents before us objected\n\nthereto.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_34\">\n</p><p id=\"p_35\">16.   The lands are situated in two different villages. The plan showing the\n\nlocation of the land vis-`-vis the National Highway No. 18 had not been\n\nplaced before us. From the award of the learned Reference Judge, it appears\n\nthat the lands situated in Pasupula village are better placed than the lands\n\nsituated in B. Thandrapadu village. Such a distinction had also been kept in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                    11</span>\n\nmind not only by the Land Acquisition Collector but also by the Reference\n\nCourt.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_36\">\n</p><p id=\"p_37\">17.      We agree with the judgment of this Court in Civil Appeal No. 5206-\n\n5228 of 1997 (A.P. Industrial Infrastructure Corporation Limited vs. G.\n\nMohan Reddy &amp; ors.) that the market value of the land would also depend\n\nupon the situation thereof.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_38\">\n</p><p id=\"p_39\">18.      Applying the said formula, if we rely on Exhibit B-3, the market\n\nvalue of the land in question would come to about Rs.1,25,000/- per acre. It\n\nis, however, not possible to agree with the submissions of Mrs. Amareswari\n\nthat we should determine the market value only on that basis upon addition\n\nof 10 per cent enhancement of the market value each year. It must be bear\n\nin mind that the lands in question were agricultural lands whereas the lands\n\nwhich were the subject matter of the said deed of sale was a homestead land,\n\nthus, some amount, therefore, will have to deducted towards the\n\ndevelopment cost.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_40\">\n</p><p id=\"p_41\">19.      Indisputably while comparing the market value of developed lands\n\nwith that of undeveloped lands, the court has to make suitable deductions\n\ntowards the cost of development.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                  12</span><p id=\"p_42\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_43\">      We, however, may notice that this Court, at different times, has\n\nspoken in different voices.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_44\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_45\">      <a href=\"/doc/1169518/\" id=\"a_6\">In P.S.

In the facts and circumstances of the present case, one-third\n\ndeduction, in our opinion, should be made towards development costs for\n\nthe lands situated both in Pasupala village as also B. Thandrapadu village.\n\nKeeping in view the fact that the lands are abutting National Highway and\n\nnear the district town, where a large number of educational institutions have\n\ncome up, 10 per cent escalation per year has to be added. Thus, Rs.\n\n1,41,666.66 per acre may be fixed for the lands in Pasupala village.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_48\">      The lands in another village B.

Challenge in this appeal, by the Union of India, is to the order dated 13th\n\n   November, 2006, passed by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad\n\n   suspending the sentence awarded by the trial Court to the respondent for having\n\n   committed offences under <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_1\">Sections 8</a>/<a href=\"/doc/935721/\" id=\"a_2\">27A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_3\">8</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1252855/\" id=\"a_4\">29</a> of the Narcotic Drugs and\n\f   <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_5\">Psychotropic Substances Act</a>, 1985 (for short `the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_6\">NDPS Act</a>') and granting him\n\n   bail.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">4. Since in this appeal we propose to deal with the short question, viz. whether the\n\n   High Court, while accepting the prayer for grant of bail, had kept in view the\n\n   parameters of <a href=\"/doc/496325/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 37</a> of the NDPS Act, we deem it unnecessary to advert to\n\n   the facts of the case against the respondent in greater detail. It would suffice to\n\n   note that the case of the prosecution against the respondent was that he was\n\n   involved in financing and trading in 14.900 kilograms of heroin, recovered from\n\n   a specially made cavity above the cabin of a truck. Upon consideration of the\n\n   evidence adduced, the Trial Court came to the conclusion that the prosecution\n\n   had successfully proved the charges against the respondent and three others.\n\n   On conviction, the Trial Court sentenced the respondent to undergo rigorous\n\n   imprisonment for ten years and to pay a fine of Rs.1 lac under <a href=\"/doc/935721/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 27A</a> of\n\n   the NDPS Act and undergo rigorous imprisonment for ten years and a fine of\n\n   Rs.1 lac under <a href=\"/doc/1252855/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 29</a> of the NDPS Act, with default stipulation.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">5. Being aggrieved, the respondent preferred an appeal to the High Court along\n\n   with an application for suspension of sentence and grant of bail till his appeal\n\n   was finally decided. The High Court, by the impugned order, has allowed the bail\n\n   application and has ordered that the respondent shall be released on bail on his\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                                     2</span>\n\f  executing a personal bond and furnishing two sureties each in the like amount\n\n  to the satisfaction of the concerned Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">6. The considerations which weighed with the High Court for suspension of\n\n  sentence and grant of bail are brief and for the sake of ready reference are\n\n  extracted below:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">              \"The appellant has been convicted under <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_10\">Sections 8</a>/<a href=\"/doc/935721/\" id=\"a_11\">27-A</a> and\n     <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_12\">8</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1252855/\" id=\"a_13\">29</a> N.D.P.S. Act for ten years R.I and also fine. Nothing has been found\n     from his possession. Besides the appellant is in jail since 5.9.2003. Three\n     years have already lapsed. There is no chance of the appeal being heard\n     within a period of seven years.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">  7. Aggrieved thereby, the Union of India has preferred this appeal.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">  8. Mr. A. Sharan, learned Additional Solicitor General of India, strenuously urged\n\n     that the High Court has committed a grave error of law in granting bail to the\n\n     respondent, ignoring the mandatory provisions of <a href=\"/doc/496325/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 37</a> of the NDPS\n\n     Act. The learned counsel contended that the High Court lost sight of the\n\n     restrictions and limitations imposed by <a href=\"/doc/496325/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 37</a> of the NDPS Act.\n\n     According to the learned counsel, the grant of bail to the respondent, without\n\n     recording any finding on the conditions as stipulated in <a href=\"/doc/1199025/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 37(1)(b)(ii)</a> of\n\n     the NDPS Act, the order suspending the sentence is ex facie illegal and\n\n     therefore deserves to be set aside, with a direction to the respondent to\n\n     surrender to custody forthwith. In support of the proposition that suspension\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                                    3</span>\n\f         of sentence by the appellate Court has to be within the parameters of law,\n\n         prescribed by the Legislature, the learned senior counsel placed reliance on a\n\n         three judge Bench decision of this Court in Dadu alias Tulsidas Vs. State of\n\n         Maharashtra1.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_18\">\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">      9. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent, on the other hand,\n\n         supported the impugned order and submitted that if the impugned order is\n\n         read as a whole, it can be inferred therefrom that the learned Judge was\n\n         conscious of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/496325/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 37</a> of the NDPS Act. It is, thus, urged\n\n         that the order granting bail to the respondent being discretionary, this Court\n\n         should be loath to interfere with it in exercise of its jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_18\">Article\n\n         136</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_20\">\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">      10. Having carefully gone through the impugned order, we are constrained to\n\n         observe that while dealing with the application for bail, the learned Judge\n\n         appears to have lost sight of the mandatory requirements of <a href=\"/doc/496325/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 37</a> of\n\n         the NDPS Act and thus, the impugned order is clearly unsustainable.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">      11. The broad principles which should weigh with the Court in granting bail in a\n\n         non-bailable offence have been enumerated in a catena of decisions of this\n\n         Court and, therefore, for the sake of brevity, we do not propose to reiterate\n\n         the same. However, when a prosecution/conviction is for offence(s) under a\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">1</span>\n    (2000) 8 SCC 437\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                                          4</span>\n\f   special statute and that statute contains specific provisions for dealing with\n\n   matters arising thereunder, including an application for grant of bail, these\n\n   provisions cannot be ignored while dealing with such an application. As\n\n   already noted, in the present case, the respondent has been convicted and\n\n   sentenced for offences under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_20\">NDPS Act</a> and therefore, while dealing with\n\n   his application for grant of bail, in addition to the broad principles to be\n\n   applied in prosecution for offences under<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_21\"> the Indian Penal Code</a>, 1860 the\n\n   relevant provision in the said special statute in this regard had to be kept in\n\n   view.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_23\">\n</p><p id=\"p_24\">12.<a href=\"/doc/496325/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 37</a> of the NDPS Act, as substituted by Act 2 of 1989 with effect from\n\n   29th May, 1989 with further amendment by Act 9 of 2001 reads as follows:\n\n\n  \"37. Offences to be cognizable and non-bailable.-- (1) Notwithstanding anything\n  contained in<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_23\"> the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974)--\n\n</p><p id=\"p_25\">  (a) every offence punishable under this Act shall be cognizable;\n\n</p><p id=\"p_26\">  (b) no person accused of an offence punishable for offences under <a href=\"/doc/128102/\" id=\"a_24\">Section\n      19</a> or <a href=\"/doc/1373137/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 24</a> or <a href=\"/doc/935721/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 27A</a> and also for offences involving\n      commercial quantity shall be released on bail or on his own bond\n      unless--\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_27\">       (i)   the Public Prosecutor has been given an opportunity to oppose the\n               application for such release, and\n\n</p><p id=\"p_28\">       (ii) where the Public Prosecutor opposes the application, the court is\n             satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he\n             is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to commit\n             any offence while on bail.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_29\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                                    5</span>\n\f  (2) The limitations on granting of bail specified in clause (b) of sub-section\n  (1) are in addition to the limitations under<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_27\"> the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure,\n  1973 (12 of 1974), or any other law for the time being in force on granting\n  of bail.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_30\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_31\">13.It is plain from a bare reading of the non-obstante clause in the Section and\n\n   sub-section (2) thereof that the power to grant bail to a person accused of\n\n   having committed offence under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_28\">NDPS Act</a> is not only subject to the\n\n   limitations imposed under <a href=\"/doc/1290514/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 439</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure,\n\n   1973, it is also subject to the restrictions placed by sub-clause (b) of sub-\n\n   section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/496325/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 37</a> of the NDPS Act. Apart from giving an opportunity to\n\n   the Public Prosecutor to oppose the application for such release, the other\n\n   twin conditions viz; (i) the satisfaction of the Court that there are reasonable\n\n   grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of the alleged offence;\n\n   and (ii) that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail, have to be\n\n   satisfied.   It is manifest that the conditions are cumulative and not\n\n   alternative. The satisfaction contemplated regarding the accused being not\n\n   guilty, has to be based on \"reasonable grounds\". The expression `reasonable\n\n   grounds' has not been defined in the said Act but means something more\n\n   than prima facie grounds. It connotes substantial probable causes for believing\n\n   that the accused is not guilty of the offence he is charged with. The\n\n   reasonable belief contemplated in turn points to existence of such facts and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                                   6</span>\n\f         circumstances as are sufficient in themselves to justify satisfaction that the\n\n         accused is not guilty of the alleged offence. [Vide Union of India Vs. Shiv\n\n         Shanker Kesari2] Thus, recording of satisfaction on both the aspects, noted\n\n         above, is sine qua non for granting of bail under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_31\">NDPS Act</a>.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_32\">      14. We may, however, hasten to add that while considering an application for bail\n\n         with reference to <a href=\"/doc/496325/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 37</a> of the NDPS Act, the Court is not called upon to\n\n         record a finding of `not guilty'.   At this stage, it is neither necessary nor\n\n         desirable to weigh the evidence meticulously to arrive at a positive finding as\n\n         to whether or not the accused has committed offence under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_33\">NDPS Act</a>.\n\n         What is to be seen is whether there is reasonable ground for believing that\n\n         the accused is not guilty of the offence(s) he is charged with and further that\n\n         he is not likely to commit an offence under the said Act while on bail. The\n\n         satisfaction of the Court about the existence of the said twin conditions is for\n\n         a limited purpose and is confined to the question of releasing the accused on\n\n         bail.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_33\">\n</p><p id=\"p_34\">      15. Bearing in mind the above broad principles, we may now consider the merits\n\n         of the present appeal. It is evident from the afore-extracted paragraph that\n\n         the circumstances which have weighed with the learned Judge to conclude\n\n         that it was a fit case for grant of bail are : (i) that nothing has been found\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">2</span>\n    (2007) 7 SCC 798\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                                                        7</span>\n\f  from the possession of the respondent; (ii) he is in jail for the last three years\n\n  and (iii) that there is no chance of his appeal being heard within a period of\n\n  seven years. In our opinion, the stated circumstances may be relevant for\n\n  grant of bail in matters arising out of conviction under<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_34\"> the Indian Penal Code</a>,\n\n  1860 etc. but are not sufficient to satisfy the mandatory requirements as\n\n  stipulated in sub-clause (b) of sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/496325/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 37</a> of the NDPS Act.\n\n  Merely because, according to the Ld. Judge,       nothing was found from the\n\n  possession of the respondent, it could not be said at this stage that the\n\n  respondent was not guilty of the offences for which he had been charged and\n\n  convicted. We find no substance in the argument of learned counsel for the\n\n  respondent that the observation of the learned Judge to the effect that\n\n  \"nothing has been found from his possession\" by itself shows application of\n\n  mind by the Ld. Judge tantamounting to \"satisfaction\" within the meaning of\n\n  the said provision. It seems that the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_36\">NDPS Act</a> and more\n\n  particularly <a href=\"/doc/496325/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 37</a> were not brought to the notice of the learned Judge.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_35\">16. Thus, in our opinion, the impugned order having been passed ignoring the\n\n  mandatory requirements of <a href=\"/doc/496325/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 37</a> of the NDPS Act, it cannot be\n\n  sustained. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the matter is remitted back\n\n  to the High Court for fresh consideration of the application filed by the\n\n  respondent for suspension of sentence and for granting of bail, keeping in\n\n  view the parameters of <a href=\"/doc/496325/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 37</a> of the NDPS Act, enumerated above. We\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                                   8</span>\n\f     further direct that the bail application shall be taken up for consideration\n\n     only after the respondent surrenders to custody. The respondent is directed\n\n     to surrender to custody within two weeks of the date of this order, failing\n\n     which the High Court will take appropriate steps for his arrest.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_36\">  17.

Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a Division Bench of\n\nthe Bombay High Court dismissing the Writ Petition filed by the appellant\n\non the ground that it was highly belated. It also noted that the appellant had\n\nreceived compensation in respect of the land which was acquired.\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">\f3.    Background facts in a nutshell are as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">      In the year 1971 Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (in\n\nshort `MIDC') acquired about 1250 acres of agricultural land situated at\n\nfour villages in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra. Thirty eight acres of land\n\nbelonging to the appellant were acquired. It is the stand of the appellant that\n\nout of the acquired area, about 50% was under paddy cultivation and 25%\n\nwas under cultivation of mango crops. In the appellant's land about 175\n\nmango trees were there. In the year 1973, the Revenue and Forest\n\nDepartment of the Maharashtra Government passed a resolution inter-alia\n\ndeciding to take steps in respect of surplus acquired land which remained\n\nunutilized for a period of three years from the date of taking over possession\n\nfor resumption of such lands in accordance with the applicable rules and\n\norders. In 1974, a Writ Petition was filed by the appellant challenging the\n\nNotification for acquisition and an arrangement was worked out in which 20\n\nacres of appellant's land out of 38 acres were released. The lands were\n\nacquired for a Govt. company-Balco for setting up a manufacturing unit.\n\nSince Balco did not set up any unit, license issued to it was cancelled. In the\n\nyear 1982, appellant claims to have made representations alongwith\n\nsimilarly situated land owners for restoration of the acquired land to the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                     2</span>\n\foriginal owners. In the year 1983, compensation was paid to 686 land\n\nowners. In 1984, again the appellant made a representation to the Collector\n\nof Ratnagiri for release of the land. On 20.7.1989 a Committee was\n\nappointed by the Legislative Assembly for consideration of the proposal for\n\nhanding back the acquired land to the original owners.               Certain\n\nrecommendations were made by the said Committee. On 20.8.1992 the land\n\nacquired for Balco was allotted to another industrial group. Subsequently,\n\nthe State Government asked the industrial group not to continue the\n\nconstruction activities in view of pendency of cases. On 12.11.2002,\n\nrepresentations were again made to hand back the land not utilized. It was\n\nthe specific stand of the appellant that in view of Section 39(2a) of the\n\nMaharashtra Industrial Development Act, 1961 (in short the `Act') the land\n\nshould be restored. The High Court dismissed the writ petition on the\n\nground that it was highly belated.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">4.    In support of the appeal, learned counsel for the appellant stated that\n\nthe appellant was all through representing to the authorities and because of\n\nthe recommendations by the Committee, the appellant waited for some time\n\nand ultimately when no worthwhile action was taken, he filed the writ\n\npetition.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                     3</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">\f5.    Learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand supported the\n\njudgment of the High Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">6.    It is pointed out that the recommendations made in terms of the\n\nresolution were not accepted by the Government. It was decided that since\n\ndefinite policy has been formulated the land is to be utilized for the\n\nindustrial development, the same cannot be surrendered to the original\n\nowners for cultivation purposes. It is also pointed out that the so called\n\nrepresentations do not in any way assist the appellant to explain the long\n\ndelay in filing the writ petition.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">7.    It is also pointed out that Section 39(2a) is applicable only in respect\n\nof the undeveloped land, and in the instant case the land in question is\n\ndeveloped land.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">8.    Delay or laches is one of the factors which is to be borne in mind by\n\nthe High Courts when they exercise their discretionary powers under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_1\">Article\n\n226</a> of the Constitution of India, 1950 (in short the `Constitution'). In an\n\nappropriate case the High Court may refuse to invoke its extraordinary\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                     4</span>\n\fpowers if there is such negligence or omission on the part of the applicant to\n\nassert his right as taken in conjunction with the lapse of time and other\n\ncircumstances, causes prejudice to the opposite party. Even where\n\nfundamental right is involved the matter is still within the discretion of the\n\nCourt as pointed out in <a href=\"/doc/124778/\" id=\"a_2\">Durga Prasad v. Chief Controller of Imports and\n\nExports</a> (AIR 1970 SC 769). Of course, the discretion has to be exercised\n\njudicially and reasonably.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_18\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">9.    What was stated in this regard by Sir Barnes Peacock in Lindsay\n\nPetroleum Company v. Prosper Armstrong Hurde etc. (1874) 5 PC 221 at\n\npage 239 was approved by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/96294865/\" id=\"a_3\">Moon Mills Ltd. v. Industrial\n\nCourts</a> (AIR 1967 SC 1450) and <a href=\"/doc/95685/\" id=\"a_4\">Maharashtra State Transport Corporation\n\nv. Balwant Regular Motor Service</a> (AIR 1969 SC 329), Sir Barnes had\n\nstated:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_20\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">             \"Now the doctrine of laches in Courts of Equity is not an\n             arbitrary or technical doctrine. Where it would be\n             practically unjust to give a remedy either because the\n             party has, by his conduct done that which might fairly be\n             regarded as equivalent to a waiver of it, or where by his\n             conduct and neglect he has though perhaps not waiving\n             that remedy, yet put the other party in a situation in\n             which it would not be reasonable to place him if the\n             remedy were afterwards to be asserted, in either of these\n             cases, lapse of time and delay are most material. But in\n             every case, if an argument against relief, which\n             otherwise would be just, if founded upon mere delay,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                     5</span>\n\f             that delay of course not amounting to a bar by any statute\n             of limitation, the validity of that defence must be tried\n             upon     principles      substantially    equitable.  Two\n             circumstances always important in such cases are, the\n             length of the delay and the nature of the acts done during\n             the interval which might affect either party and cause a\n             balance of justice or injustice in taking the one course or\n             the other, so far as relates to the remedy.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_21\">10.   It would be appropriate to note certain decisions of this Court in\n\nwhich this aspect has been dealt with in relation with <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 32</a> of the\n\nConstitution. It is apparent that what has been stated as regards that Article\n\nwould apply, a fortiori, to <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 226.</a> It was observed in <a href=\"/doc/148092167/\" id=\"a_7\">R.N Bose v.\n\nUnion of India</a> (AIR 1970 SC 470) that no relief can be given to the\n\npetitioner who without any reasonable explanation approaches this Court\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 32</a> after inordinate delay. It was stated that though <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 32</a>\n\nis itself a guaranteed right, it does not follow from this that it was the\n\nintention of the Constitution makers that this Court should disregard all\n\nprinciples and grant relief in petitions filed after inordinate delay.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">11.   It was stated in <a href=\"/doc/320843/\" id=\"a_10\">State of M.P. v. Nandlal</a> (AIR 1987 SC 251) that the\n\nHigh Court in exercise of its discretion does not ordinarily assist the tardy\n\nand the indolent or the acquiescent and the lethargic. If there is inordinate\n\ndelay on the part of the petitioner and such delay is not satisfactorily\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                      6</span>\n\fexplained, the High Court may decline to intervene and grant relief in\n\nexercise of its writ jurisdiction. It was stated that this rule is premised on a\n\nnumber of factors. The High Court does not ordinarily permit a belated\n\nresort to the extraordinary remedy because it is likely to cause confusion\n\nand public inconvenience and bring in its trail new injustices, and if writ\n\njurisdiction is exercised after unreasonable delay, it may have the effect of\n\ninflicting not only hardship and inconvenience but also injustice on third\n\nparties. It was pointed out that when writ jurisdiction is invoked,\n\nunexplained delay coupled with the creation of third party rights in the\n\nmeantime is an important factor which also weighs with the High Court in\n\ndeciding whether or not to exercise such jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">12.

The\nHigh Court of Gujarat (respondent) received a complaint\nwherein it was alleged that a case bearing Criminal Case No.\n\f2059/89 under the <a href=\"/doc/1824663/\" id=\"a_1\">Gambling Act</a> was listed for hearing in the\nappellant's Court and that the appellant had acquitted the\naccused and also returned the money seized from the accused\nfrom the scene of occurrence. On the basis of this complaint\nthe respondent issued a charge-sheet to the appellant and the\nappellant submitted his reply. A departmental inquiry was\ninitiated against the appellant and the concerned Inquiry\nofficer submitted his report to the High Court of Gujarat\nstating that the charges levelled against the appellant had\nbeen proved. On the basis of this report, a show-cause notice\nwas issued to the appellant. The appellant filed his reply to\nthis show-cause notice. Dissatisfied with the appellant's reply,\nthe High Court decided that it would be appropriate to dismiss\nthe appellant from service. By letter dated October 25, 2001,\nthe High Court of Gujarat recommended to the State\nGovernment that the appellant be dismissed from service and\naccordingly an order was passed.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_5\">     The   appellant,   being   aggrieved,   filed   Special   Civil\nApplication No. 6164 of 2002 before the High Court of Gujarat\nat Ahmedabad, which has been dismissed by the impugned\norder.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_6\">     Hence, this appeal by grant of special leave.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                2</span>\n<p id=\"p_7\">\f     The learned counsel for the appellant has submitted\nbefore us that one of the members of the Disciplinary\nCommittee of the High Court of Gujarat which dealt with the\nappellant's appeal was one of the judges on the bench which\nheard Special Civil Application No. 6164 of 2002 on the\njudicial side. This fact has not been contested by the learned\ncounsel appearing for the respondents.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_8\">     In view of this, it is our opinion that the learned judge\nwho was part of the Disciplinary Committee which suggested\nthe appellant's dismissal should not have later heard the\nmatter on the judicial side. In the present case, the\nDisciplinary   Committee     had   suggested    the   appellant's\ndismissal on the basis of which the High Court of Gujarat\nmade    the    subsequent    recommendation      to   the   State\ngovernment.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_9\">     The decision made by the Disciplinary Committee was a\nvital component of the process by which the High Court of\nGujarat made the recommendation to the State government\nfor the dismissal of the appellant. It is therefore not proper for\na member of the said Disciplinary Committee to decide on a\nchallenge against the same dismissal order while acting in a\npurely judicial capacity.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                              3</span>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\f     It is an accepted principle of natural justice that a person\nshould not be a judge in his or her own cause. In common\nlaw, this principle has been derived from the Latin maxim -\n`nemo debet esse judex in propria sua causa'. A reasonable\npermutation of this principle is that no judge should\nadjudicate a dispute which he or she has dealt with in any\ncapacity, other than a purely judicial one. The failure to\nadhere to this principle creates an apprehension of bias on\npart of the said judge. It would be useful to refer to the\nobservations of Justice P.N. Bhagwati in <a href=\"/doc/634160/\" id=\"a_2\">Ashok Kumar Yadav\nv. State of Haryana</a>, (1985) 4 SCC 417:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">           \"One of the fundamental principles of our\n      jurisprudence is that no man can be a judge in his\n      own cause. The question is not whether the judge is\n      actually biased or has in fact decided partially but\n      whether the circumstances are such as to create a\n      reasonable apprehension in the mind of others that\n      there is a likelihood of bias affecting the decision. If\n      there is a reasonable likelihood of bias `it is in\n      accordance with natural justice and common sense\n      that the judge likely to be so biased should be\n      incapacitated from sitting'. The basic principle\n      underlying this rule is that justice must not only be\n      done but must also appear to be done.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                 4</span>\n<p id=\"p_11\">\f     Accordingly, we accept this appeal, set aside the\nimpugned order of the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad\nand remit the case to the High Court to decide it afresh in\naccordance with law.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p_12\">                                 ..................................CJ I\n                                 [ K.G.

Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the\n\nBombay High Court upholding the conviction of the appellant for the\n\noffence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_1\">Sections 302</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1542359/\" id=\"a_2\">321</a> and <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_3\">201</a> of the Indian Penal\n\fCode, 1860 (in short the `<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_4\">IPC</a>') and sentence of life, nine months and nine\n\nmonths respectively and fine with default stipulation.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">3.    Background facts in a nutshell are as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">      The accused Shiva Karam Payaswami Tewar was working in Hotel\n\nPremier run by the complainant Anthony Xavier at Dharavi, Mumbai-70.\n\nThe accused was entrusted with the work of preparation of spices.\n\nMuttukumar (hereinafter referred to as the `deceased') was working as a\n\nmanager in the said hotel. Considering the nature of their work the accused\n\nas well as Muttukumar used to stay overnight in the hotel.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">      On 31.8.1995 in the evening complainant Anthony Xavier went to the\n\nHotel Premier and after usual supervision and talk with manager at night he\n\nreturned. At that time the accused as well as Muttukumar were in the hotel.\n\nOn the next day morning i.e. on 1.9.1995 one Murugan Shetiya working in\n\nthe hotel went to Anthony (PW-1) and told him that the hotel is open and\n\nMuttukumar and accused are not present in the hotel. He also informed that\n\ncash drawer was open and tape recorder was found missing. Naturally,\n\ncomplainant Anthony immediately went to the hotel. When he was making\n\nquery, Arun Pujari, who was running Pan bidi shop near the hotel and taxi\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                    2</span>\n\fdriver Suresh Kumar who often used to park his taxi near the hotel told him\n\nthat accused met them at about 5.30 a.m., and made enquiry about the bus\n\ngoing to Bangalore. When complainant took survey of the hotel he found\n\nthat cash box was open and tape recorder kept in the hotel was missing.\n\nThere was no cash in the cash box. According to him on the previous night\n\nthe manager i.e. deceased had informed him that on that day amount of\n\nRs.3500/- was collected and the same was kept in the cash box. Report was\n\nlodged with the police and investigation was undertaken. Appellant was\n\nsuspected to be the murderer.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">      After completion of investigation charge-sheet was filed. Since the\n\naccused pleaded innocence, trial was held. Though there was no direct\n\nevidence the Trial Court held that the circumstantial evidences adduced by\n\nthe prosecution were sufficient. Particular reference was made to the extra-\n\njudicial confession made before PW-1. Accordingly, conviction was\n\nrecorded by the Trial Court. Appellant filed appeal before the High Court\n\nwhich upheld the conviction.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">      Before the High Court the stand was that even if the extra judicial\n\nconfession is accepted to be correct for the sake of argument, case under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 302</a> IPC is not made out. The stand of the prosecution was that the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                    3</span>\n\fextra-judicial confession clearly showed both the intention and the\n\nknowledge. Accordingly, the High Court dismissed the appeal. The stand\n\ntaken before the High Court was reiterated by the parties. In addition,\n\nlearned counsel for the appellant submitted that there was no pre-meditation\n\nand in the course of quarrel, a wooden log which was lying was picked up\n\nby the appellant in a heat of passion and assault was made. Only one blow\n\nwas given and, therefore, <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 302</a> IPC, in any event, has no application.\n\nIt was submitted that extra-judicial confession is a very weak piece of\n\nevidence and should not have been made the basis for conviction.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">4.    We shall first deal with the question regarding claim of extra judicial\n\nconfession. Though it is not necessary that the witness should speak the\n\nexact words but there cannot be vital and material difference. While dealing\n\nwith a stand of extra judicial confession, Court has to satisfy itself that the\n\nsame was voluntary and without any coercion and undue influence. Extra\n\njudicial confession can form the basis of conviction if persons before whom\n\nit is stated to be made appear to be unbiased and not even remotely inimical\n\nto the accused. Where there is material to show animosity, Court has to\n\nproceed cautiously and find out whether confession just like any other\n\nevidence depends on veracity of witness to whom it is made. It is not\n\ninvariable that the Court should not accept such evidence if actual words as\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                     4</span>\n\fclaimed to have been spoken are not reproduced and the substance is given.\n\nIt will depend on circumstance of the case. If substance itself is sufficient to\n\nprove culpability and there is no ambiguity about import of the statement\n\nmade by accused, evidence can be acted upon even though substance and\n\nnot actual words have been stated. Human mind is not a tape recorder which\n\nrecords what has been spoken word by word. The witness should be able to\n\nsay as nearly as possible actual words spoken by the accused. That would\n\nrule out possibility of erroneous interpretation of any ambiguous statement.\n\nIf word by word repetition of statement of the case is insisted upon, more\n\noften than not evidentiary value of extra judicial confession has to be\n\nthrown out as unreliable and not useful. That cannot be a requirement in\n\nlaw. There can be some persons who have a good memory and may be able\n\nto repost exact words and there may he many who are possessed of normal\n\nmemory and do so. It is for the Court to judge credibility of the witness's\n\ncapacity and thereafter to decide whether his or her evidence has to be\n\naccepted or not. If Court believes witnesses before whom confession is\n\nmade and is satisfied that confession was voluntary basing on such\n\nevidence, conviction can be founded. Such confession should be clear,\n\nspecific and unambiguous.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                      5</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">\f5.    The expression `confession' is not defined in the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_7\">Evidence Act</a>,\n\n`Confession' is a statement made by an accused which must either admit in\n\nterms the offence, or at any rate substantially all the facts which constitute\n\nthe offence. The dictionary meaning of the word `statement' is \"act of\n\nstating; that which is stated; a formal account, declaration of facts etc.\" The\n\nword `statement' includes both oral and written statement. Communication\n\nto another is not however an essential component to constitute a `statement'.\n\nAn accused might have been over-heard uttering to himself or saying to his\n\nwife or any other person in confidence. He might have also uttered\n\nsomething in soliloquy. He might also keep a note in writing. All the\n\naforesaid nevertheless constitute a statement. It such statement is an\n\nadmission of guilt, it would amount to a confession whether it is\n\ncommunicated to another or not. This very question came up for\n\nconsideration before this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1643745/\" id=\"a_8\">Sahoo v. State of Uttar Pradesh</a>, AIR\n\n1966 SC 40: (1966 Cr1 U 68). After referring to some passages written by\n\nwell known authors on the \"Law of Evidence\" Subba Rao, J. (as he then\n\nwas) held that \"communication is not a necessary ingredient to constitute\n\nconfession\". In paragraph 5 of the judgment, this Court held as follows:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">             ...Admissions and confessions are exceptions to the\n             hearsay rule. <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_9\">The Evidence Act</a> places them in the\n             category of relevant evidence presumably on the ground\n             that as they are declarations against the interest of the\n             person making them, they are probably true. The\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                     6</span>\n\f            probative value of an admission or a confession goes not\n            to depend upon its communication to another, though,\n            just like any other piece of evidence, it can be admitted\n            in evidence only on proof. This proof in the case of oral\n            admission or confession can be offered only by witnesses\n            who heard the admission pr confession. as the case may\n            be.... If, as we have said, statement is the genus and\n            confession is only a sub-species of that genus, we do not\n            see any reason why the statement implied in the\n            confession should be given a different meaning. We,\n            therefore, hold that a statement, whether communicated\n            or not, admitting guilt is a confession of guilt\n\n                                   (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p id=\"p_17\">6.    The extra-judicial confession purported to have been made before\n\nPW1 reads as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_18\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                   \"He was brought to the hotel in a taxi. In enquired\n            with the accd. what he did to Muttukumar. The accd.\n            disclosed that he and Muttukumar got up at about 4.30\n            a.m. and while he was preparing spices there was quarrel\n            between them; and as a result of the quarrel he had hit\n            Muttukumar with a wooden log used for cutting\n            vegetables and Muttukumar had died of the injuries\n            sustained during the assault.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_19\">7.    In the instant case the extra-judicial confession is believable as rightly\n\ndone by the Trial Court and the High Court. The same not was made to a\n\nstranger but to a friend. Therefore, the Trial Court and the High Court have\n\nrightly acted upon the extra-judicial confession.      At the same time the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                     7</span>\n\fbackground in which the assault has been made clearly shows that <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_10\">Section\n\n302</a> IPC has no application. The assault was made in the course of sudden\n\nquarrel without pre-meditation. The accused was not armed at the relevant\n\npoint of time. Even according to prosecution he picked up the wooden log\n\nwhich was lying there and made the assault.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_20\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">8.    That being the position, we alter the conviction to <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 304</a> Part II\n\nIPC. Custodial sentence of 8 years would meet the ends of justice. The\n\nappeal is allowed to the aforesaid extent.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_22\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">9.

Appellants are before us aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the\n\njudgment and order dated 11.04.2005 passed by a Division Bench of the\n\nHigh Court of Calcutta, Circuit Bench at Port Blair whereby and\n\nwhereunder the writ petition filed by the respondent herein was allowed.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                        2</span>\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">3.       The basic fact of the matter is not in dispute.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">         An advertisement was issued for filling up the post of Postman/ Mail\n\nGuard under the quota of Extra-departmental candidate at Andaman and\n\nNicobar Island, Port Blair.        Respondent herein pursuant thereto or in\n\nfurtherance thereof applied for the said post. He appeared at an examination\n\nheld for the said purpose. On or about 18.11.1997, the purported results of\n\nthe said examination were published with the remarks \"none qualified\".\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">4.       Subsequently, some other examinations were also held in which the\n\nrespondent participated. Indisputably, he was a member of the Scheduled\n\nCaste.     He filed several representations before the concerned various\n\nauthorities contending that his candidature had not been considered despite\n\nthe fact that he had obtained more than 30% of marks which was the cut-off\n\nmark for the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. As\n\nthe said representations were not responded to, he filed an original\n\napplication before the Central Administrative Tribunal, Calcutta Bench,\n\nKolkata. The said original application was dismissed on 12.9.2003 on the\n\nground of limitation as also on merit, stating:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">               \"Considering the respective contentions of the ld.\n               Counsels for both sides, we find that the applicant\n               having not been qualified in the written test as\n               well as in the interview does not acquire any legal\n               or enforceable right to seek employment for the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                        3</span>\n\n\n                 post. In the result, the application is dismissed\n                 without any order as to cost.\"\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\n\n</blockquote><p id=\"p_9\">5.         Respondent filed a writ petition before the High Court questioning\n\nthe legality and/or validity of the said judgment and order which was\n\nmarked as WP CT No. 194 of 2003. The said writ petition was initially\n\ndismissed on 9.7.2004 by a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court,\n\nstating:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                 \"Therefore, although, we do not approve the\n                 reason assigned by the Tribunal, we are not\n                 inclined to entertain this application as the\n                 ultimate conclusion of the Tribunal that the\n                 petitioner was not entitled to get any relief was\n                 correct. As indicated above, the Tribunal ought to\n                 have rejected the application only on the ground of\n                 limitation.\"\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">\n\n</blockquote><p id=\"p_10\">6.         However, a review application filed thereagainst was allowed. By\n\nreason of the impugned judgment dated 11.04.2005, the High Court has\n\nallowed the said writ application.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">7.         Mr. B. Datta, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing on\n\nbehalf of the appellants, would contend:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">     (i)      the High Court committed a serious error insofar as it failed to\n\n              take into consideration that having regard to the fact that the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                        4</span>\n\n\n               respondent failed to pass the tests held in the year 1997 and\n\n               furthermore, having appeared in the subsequent examinations, had\n\n               no right to be appointed and no direction for his appointment in\n\n               the post of Peon or Group `D', thus, could be issued by the High\n\n               Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">     (ii)      Respondent having applied against the vacancy in the `OC'\n\n               category and not in the category of `Scheduled Caste', it was\n\n               obligatory on him to obtain the qualifying marks of 45% which he\n\n               having failed to obtain, the impugned judgment is wholly\n\n               unsustainable.\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"p_12\">8.          Mrs. Sarda Devi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nrespondent, however, would support the impugned judgment.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">9.          Before adverting to the contentions raised before us by the learned\n\ncounsel for the parties, we may notice that the appellants suppressed a\n\nmaterial fact. It appears that the fact that the High Court had recalled its\n\nearlier order dated 9.07.2004 by an order dated 30.11.2004 had not been\n\nmentioned in the list of dates. This Court, therefore, must have proceeded\n\non the basis that the impugned order was passed on a review application and\n\nnot in the original writ proceedings. We do not find appropriate words to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                    5</span>\n\n\ndeprecate such a practice and that too by the Union of India. We should\n\nhave dismissed the Special Leave Petition on this ground alone.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">      Let us, however, also consider the merit of the matter.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">10.   The fact that the respondent is a member of Scheduled Caste is not in\n\ndispute. His name figured at Sl.No. 124 of the seniority list of Dak Sevakas\n\nin A &amp; N Islands Divisions, Port Blair. It has not been denied or disputed\n\nbefore us that in Central Administrative Services, a person belonging to\n\nScheduled Caste in any State would be deemed to be a member of the\n\nScheduled Caste.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">      Respondent, therefore, should have been treated to be a member of\n\n`Schedule Caste' for the purpose of consideration of his candidature.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">11.   The High Court in its impugned order categorically held that the\n\nappellants at no point of time denied or disputed that the respondent had\n\nobtained marks more than 30% but less than 45%.            The High Court\n\nfurthermore noticed that the notification dated 9.06.1989 issued by the\n\nDirector of Postal Services, A &amp; N Islands in categorical terms stated that\n\nhis status of the Scheduled Castes should be accepted and recognized in the\n\ndepartment examination. A member of a Scheduled Caste, thus, notified in\n\nany of the States within the territories of India, having regard to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                    6</span>\n\n\nprovisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/68762/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 341</a> of the Constitution, was entitled to get\n\nthe benefit of the said status for the purpose of entering into Central Civil\n\nService..\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_18\">12.   The High Court furthermore has rightly held that as a member of the\n\nScheduled Caste, the respondent was entitled to the benefit of the lower\n\npercentage of marks, viz., 30% in the departmental examination for\n\npromotion from the post of Extra-Departmental Mail Guard to the Post of\n\nPeon or Group `D'.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_19\">13.   If, thus, for the reasons known to the respondent that he was entitled\n\nto the benefit of the status of the Scheduled Caste in the Andaman and\n\nNicobar Islands, irrespective of the fact that the advertisement issued\n\nrecognized only two categories of reserve categories, viz., Scheduled Tribes\n\nand `OC', there was no reason to deprive the respondent from the said\n\nbenefit. Respondent, therefore, was not appointed because of a mistake\n\ncommitted on the part of the authorities of the appellants. They, thus,\n\ncannot be permitted to take advantage of the same.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">14.   In that view of the matter, the delay in filing the original application\n\nshould not be held to be a bar in granting him an equitable relief. Union of\n\nIndia as a benevolent litigant cannot be permitted to take advantage of its\n\nown wrong.     Furthermore, the appellants are guilty of suppression of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                      7</span>\n\n\nmaterial facts before this Court. It, in its list of dates, did not state that the\n\noriginal order of the High Court dated 9.07.2004 had been recalled and\n\nreviewed by the Division of the said Court by an order dated 30.10.2004.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">15.   For the reasons aforementioned, the impugned judgment should not\n\nbe interfered with and is directed accordingly. The appeal is dismissed with\n\ncosts. Counsel's fee assessed at Rs.1,00,000/-.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">                                          ......................................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">                                          (S.B.

Prosecution version unfolded during trial is as follows:-\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">      On 23-04-1988 at about 2.05 p.m., the accused Krishnalal lodged an\n\noral report Ex.P/12 before Jagmalram (PW-11) SHO, Police Station Purani\n\nAbadi, Sri Ganganagar stating inter-alia that he was married with Smt. Raju,\n\n(hereinafter referred to as the deceased) in the year 1984 and his father had\n\nalready died before 15 years back and since then he was living with his\n\nmother Prem Kanwar, the present appellant and uncle Puran Chand and he\n\nwas not in service and thus was unemployed. On that day, he went out from\n\nhis house for some work and when he returned back at about 1.30 p.m. he\n\nfound crowd near his house and also found fire in his house and people\n\nwere extinguishing the fire and he came to know that his wife, the deceased\n\nwas burnt and had died and, therefore, he had come to inform the police.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">      On this report, police registered the FIR No. 7/88 and started\n\ninvestigation.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">      During investigation, postmortem of the dead body of the deceased\n\nwas got conducted and the post mortem report is Ex.

P/1 on 26-4-1988\n\nbefore police station Purani Abadi, Sri Ganganagar stating inter-alia that all\n\nthe three accused have murdered his daughter (deceased) by burning her and\n\nhe had also come to know that a report was also lodged on behalf of the\n\naccused stating therein that the deceased had committed suicide, but the fact\n\nwas that all the three accused have killed her. It was further stated in the\n\nreport that all the three accused used to harass and torture her as she was an\n\nilliterate lady and accused no 1 Krishnalal (husband of the deceased) was an\n\neducated person and accused used to say that in dowry nothing was given to\n\nthem and thus, they used to torture, harass and humiliate her. It was further\n\nstated in the report that action be taken against the accused for killing her\n\ndaughter (deceased) by burning.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">      On this report, police chalked out FIR Ex.

Thereafter,\n\nthe case was committed to the Court of Session.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">      As the accused persons denied the allegations trial was held. Eleven\n\nwitnesses were examined to establish the accusations. Learned Sessions\n\nJudge directed acquittal inter-alia holding as follows:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      1.

The High Court found that the\n\npossibility that before burning the deceased was murdered was clear from\n\nthe evidence.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">3.    Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that considering the\n\nlimited nature of the scope of interference in a matter of acquittal, the High\n\nCourt ought not to have interfered, particularly, when it found that the\n\nacquittal was in order so far as the other co-accused persons are concerned.\n\nIt was submitted that the High Court's conclusion that the skull bones were\n\nbroken, which rules out the case of suicide, is contrary to medical evidence.\n\nThe High Court noted that to bring in application of <a href=\"/doc/1439698/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 304</a> Part B, it\n\nis immaterial whether the death is suicidal or homicidal.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                          5</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">\f4.

Explanation to <a href=\"/doc/1763444/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 304-B</a> refers to dowry \"as having the same\n\nmeaning as in <a href=\"/doc/1249134/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 2</a> of the Act\", the question is : what is the periphery\n\nof the dowry as defined therein ? The argument is, there has to be an\n\nagreement at the time of the marriage in view of the words \"agreed to be\n\ngiven\" occurring therein, and in the absence of any such evidence it would\n\nnot constitute to be a dowry. It is noticeable, as this definition by\n\namendment includes not only the period before and at the marriage but also\n\nthe period subsequent to the marriage. This position was highlighted in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/60202/\" id=\"a_22\">Pawan Kumar and Ors. v. State of Haryana</a> (1998 (3) SCC 309).\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_36\">9.    The offence alleged against the accused is under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 304-B</a> IPC\n\nwhich makes \"demand of dowry\" itself punishable. Demand neither\n\nconceives nor would conceive of any agreement. If for convicting any\n\noffender, agreement for dowry is to be proved, hardly any offenders would\n\ncome under the clutches of law. When <a href=\"/doc/1763444/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 304-B</a> refers to \"demand of\n\ndowry\", it refers to the demand of property or valuable security as referred\n\nto in the definition of \"dowry\" under the Act. The argument that there is no\n\ndemand of dowry, in the present case, has no force. In cases of dowry deaths\n\nand suicides, circumstantial evidence plays an important role and inferences\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                                        9</span>\n\fcan be drawn on the basis of such evidence. That could be either direct or\n\nindirect. It is significant that <a href=\"/doc/1023340/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 4</a> of the Act, was also amended by\n\nmeans of Act 63 of 1984, under which it is an offence to demand dowry\n\ndirectly or indirectly from the parents or other relatives or guardian of a\n\nbride. The word \"agreement\" referred to in <a href=\"/doc/1249134/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 2</a> has to be inferred on\n\nthe facts and circumstances of each case. The interpretation that the accused\n\nseek, that conviction can only be if there is agreement for dowry, is\n\nmisconceived. This would be contrary to the mandate and object of the Act.\n\n\"Dowry\" definition is to be interpreted with the other provisions of the Act\n\nincluding <a href=\"/doc/751411/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 3</a>, which refers to giving or taking dowry and <a href=\"/doc/1023340/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 4</a>\n\nwhich deals with a penalty for demanding dowry, under the Act and the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_29\">IPC</a>. This makes it clear that even demand of dowry on other ingredients\n\nbeing satisfied is punishable. It is not always necessary that there be any\n\nagreement for dowry.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_37\">\n</p><p id=\"p_38\">10.   <a href=\"/doc/1906/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 113-B</a> of the Evidence Act is also relevant for the case at\n\nhand. Both <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 304-B</a> IPC and <a href=\"/doc/1906/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 113-B</a> of the Evidence Act were\n\ninserted as noted earlier by the <a href=\"/doc/1763444/\" id=\"a_33\">Dowry Prohibition (Amendment) Act</a> 43 of\n\n1986 with a view to combat the increasing menace of dowry deaths. <a href=\"/doc/1763444/\" id=\"a_34\">Section\n\n113-B</a> reads as follows:-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_39\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                         10</span>\n\f             \"113-B: Presumption as to dowry death- When the\n             question is whether a person has committed the dowry\n             death of a woman and it is shown that soon before her\n             death such woman has been subjected by such person to\n             cruelty or harassment for, or in connection with, any\n             demand for dowry, the Court shall presume that such\n             person had caused the dowry death.\n</p><p id=\"p_40\">             Explanation - For the purposes of this section `dowry\n             death' shall have the same meaning as in <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 304-B</a>\n             of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_41\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_42\">11.   The necessity for insertion of the two provisions has been amply\n\nanalysed by the Law Commission of India in its 21st Report dated 10th\n\nAugust, 1988 on `Dowry Deaths and Law Reform'. Keeping in view the\n\nimpediment in the pre-existing law in securing evidence to prove dowry\n\nrelated deaths, legislature thought it wise to insert a provision relating to\n\npresumption of dowry death on proof of certain essentials. It is in this\n\nbackground presumptive <a href=\"/doc/1763444/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 113-B</a> in the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_37\">Evidence Act</a> has been\n\ninserted.

(This means that the presumption can be raised\n\n             only if the accused is being tried for the offence under\n\n             <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 304-B</a> IPC).\n</blockquote>\n<pre id=\"pre_2\">             (2)      The woman was subjected to cruelty or\n\n             harassment by her husband or his relatives.\n\n             (3)      Such cruelty or harassment was for, or in\n\n             connection with any demand for dowry.\n\n             (4)      Such cruelty or harassment was soon before her\n\n             death.\n\n\n\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">12.   A conjoint reading of <a href=\"/doc/1906/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 113-B</a> of the Evidence Act and <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_43\">Section\n\n304-B</a> IPC shows that there must be material to show that soon before her\n\ndeath the victim was subjected to cruelty or harassment. Prosecution has to\n\nrule out the possibility of a natural or accidental death so as to bring it\n\nwithin the purview of the `death occurring otherwise than in normal\n\ncircumstances'.    The expression `soon before' is very relevant where\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                                                        12</span>\n\f<a href=\"/doc/1906/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 113-B</a> of the Evidence Act and <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 304-B</a> IPC are pressed into\n\nservice. Prosecution is obliged to show that soon before the occurrence\n\nthere was cruelty or harassment and only in that case presumption operates.\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"p_43\">Evidence in that regard has to be led by prosecution. `Soon before' is a\n\nrelative term and it would depend upon circumstances of each case and no\n\nstrait-jacket formula can be laid down as to what would constitute a period\n\nof soon before the occurrence. It would be hazardous to indicate any fixed\n\nperiod, and that brings in the importance of a proximity test both for the\n\nproof of an offence of dowry death as well as for raising a presumption\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1906/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 113-B</a> of the Evidence Act. The expression `soon before her\n\ndeath' used in the substantive <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 304-B</a> IPC and <a href=\"/doc/1906/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 113-B</a> of the\n\nEvidence Act is present with the idea of proximity test. No definite period\n\nhas been indicated and the expression `soon before' is not defined. A\n\nreference to expression `soon before' used in <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 114</a>. Illustration (a) of\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_50\">Evidence Act</a> is relevant. It lays down that a Court may presume that a\n\nman who is in the possession of goods `soon after' the theft, is either the\n\nthief or has received the goods knowing them to be stolen, unless he can\n\naccount for his possession. The determination of the period which can come\n\nwithin the term `soon before' is left to be determined by the Courts,\n\ndepending upon facts and circumstances of each case. Suffice, however, to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                                          13</span>\n\findicate that the expression `soon before' would normally imply that the\n\ninterval should not be much between the concerned cruelty or harassment\n\nand the death in question. There must be existence of a proximate and live-\n\nlink between the effect of cruelty based on dowry demand and the\n\nconcerned death. If alleged incident of cruelty is remote in time and has\n\nbecome stale enough not to disturb mental equilibrium of the woman\n\nconcerned, it would be of no consequence.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_44\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_45\">13.   The Medical evidence is found in the statement of Dr. Rajendra\n\nKuinar Gupta. (PW-6). He stated that for conducting the postmortem of the\n\ndead body of the deceased, a Medical Board was constituted on 25-04-1988\n\nand apart from him, Dr. O.P. Sharma and Dr. Avinash Sardana were\n\nmembers of the Board. He further stated that dead body of the deceased was\n\nreceived on 23-04-1988 at about 8.00 p.m. and same was kept on ice and\n\npost mortem of the dead body of the deceased was conducted on 25-04-\n\n1988 and on examination, following aspects were noticed:\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">            1.    That whole body was burnt.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">            2.    That hairs of head of the deceased were totally burnt.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">            3.    That outer portion of the skull had come out.</blockquote><p id=\"p_46\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_47\">            4.    That there were nine bangles and one kada in the Left\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                                           14</span>\n\f                   forearm of the deceased.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_48\">            5.     That bones of skull of the deceased were broken.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_49\">14.   The doctors opined that cause of death of the deceased was Asphyxia\n\ndue to ante mortem burns. He has proved the post mortem report Ex.P/3.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_50\">15.   Thus, from the post mortem report Ex.P/3 and by the statement of Dr.\n\nRajendra Kumar Gupta (PW-6), the fact that deceased died because of burns\n\nis very well established and at the time of post mortem of the dead body of\n\nthe deceased, her skull bones were found broken.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_51\">16.   In the case of burning the fracture of skull is not a necessary corollary\n\nbut in the present case the skull bones were broken. Therefore, the fact\n\nremains that she was killed before death. Therefore, the High Court was\n\njustified in holding that the Sessions Judge erroneously concluded that it\n\nwas a case of suicide.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_52\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_53\">17.   Jasvinder Singh (PW-7) is an independent witness who is neighbour\n\nof the accused. His evidence is of considerable importance. According to\n\nhim, while he was standing at the place where the deceased was burning the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                                                          15</span>\n\fwitness told Ramdev for extinguishing the fire upon which the appellant\n\nsaid that the deceased has been burnt and let her burn and it is no use\n\nextinguishing the fire. This statement has been rightly highlighted by the\n\nHigh Court to show that her role as alleged by the prosecution has been\n\nestablished.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_54\">18.   The principles which would govern and regulate the hearing of appeal\n\nby the High Court against an order of acquittal passed by the trial Court\n\nhave been set out in innumerable cases of this Court and in <a href=\"/doc/1989251/\" id=\"a_51\">Ajit Savant\n\nMajagavi v. State of Karnataka</a> (AIR 1997 SC 3255) the following\n\nprinciples have been re-iterated:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_55\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">      1.    In an appeal against an order of acquittal, the High Court\n      possesses all the powers and nothing less than the powers it\n      possesses while hearing an appeal against an order of\n      conviction.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">      2. The High Court has the power to reconsider the whole issue,\n      reappraise the evidence and come to its own conclusion and\n      findings in place of the findings recorded by trial Court, if the\n      said findings are against the weight of the evidence on record,\n      or in other words, perverse.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">      3. Before reversing the finding of acquittal, the High Court has\n      to consider each ground on which the order of acquittal was\n      based and to record its own reasons for not accepting those\n      grounds not subscribing to the view expressed by the trial court\n      that the accused is entitled to acquittal.</blockquote><p id=\"p_56\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_57\">      4. In reversing the finding of acquittal, the High Court has to\n      keep in view the fact that the presumption of innocence is still\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                                                          16</span>\n\f      available in favour of the accused and the same stands fortified\n      and strengthened by the order of acquittal passed in his favour\n      by the trial court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_58\">      5.     If the High Court on a fresh scrutiny and re-appraisal of\n      the evidence and other material on record, is of the opinion that\n      there is another view which can be reasonably taken, then the\n      view which favours the accused should be adopted.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_59\">      6.      The High Court has also to keep in mind that the trial\n      court had the advantage of looking at the demeanor of\n      witnesses and observing their conduct in the Court especially\n      in the witness box.\n</p><p id=\"p_60\">      7.     The High Court has also to keep in mind that even at that\n      stage, the accused was entitled to benefit of doubt. The doubt\n      should be such as a reasonable person would honestly and\n      conscientiously entertain as to the guilt of the accused.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_61\">19.   In this respect, the decisions of this Court in Balbir Singh Vs. State of\n\nPunjab (AIR 1957 SC 216) Ram Kumar Vs. State of Haryana (AIR 1995 SC\n\n</p><p id=\"p_62\">280), Bharwad Jakshibhai Nagjibhai Vs. State of Gujarat (AIR 1995 SC\n\n2505), Hari Chand Vs. State of Delhi (AIR 1996 SC 1477), Raghbir Singh\n\nVs. State of Haryana (JT 2000 (5) SC 21), and Hari Ram Vs. State of\n\nRajasthan (JT 2000 (6) SC 254) may be seen.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_63\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_64\">20.   In Ashok Kumar Vs. State of Rajasthan (AIR 1990 SC 2134) this\n\nCourt has held as under :\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_65\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                                                           17</span>\n\f             \"While caution is the watchword, in appeal against\n             acquittal as the trial Judge has occasion to watch\n             demeanour of witnesses interference should not be made\n             merely because a different conclusion could have been\n             arrived at. Prudence demands restraint on mere\n             probability or possibility but in perversity or misreading\n             interference is imperative otherwise existence of power\n             shall be rendered meaningless. In the present case the\n             order of the trial Court is vitiated as part from deciding\n             the case on irrelevant consideration the most serious\n             error of which he was guilty and which rendered the\n             order infirm which could be set aside by the High Court\n             was that he misread the evidence and indulged in\n             conjectural inferences and surmises.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_66\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_67\">21.   The evidence of PWs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 clearly shows the greed of the\n\naccused who was persistently taunting and harassing the deceased for not\n\nhaving brought sufficient dowry. Therefore, the High Court was justified in\n\nupsetting the order of acquittal passed by the trial Court and directing her\n\nconviction. We find no merit in this appeal which is accordingly dismissed.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_68\">                                      ........................................J.\n                                      (Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT)\n\n\n\n                                      ........................................J.\n                                      (Dr. MUKUNDAKAM SHARMA)\n\n\nNew Delhi,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                                                               18</span>\n\fJanuary 7, 2009\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                  19</span>\n\f</p>"}, {"numcites":20,"covertitles":[],"relatedqs":[{"value":"ranchi","formInput":"ranchi"},{"value":"ranchi university","formInput":"ranchi%20university"},{"value":"itdc","formInput":"itdc"},{"value":"degree certificate","formInput":"degree%20certificate"},{"value":"criminal petition","formInput":"criminal%20petition"},{"value":"criminal writ petition","formInput":"criminal%20writ%20petition"},{"value":"criminal writs","formInput":"criminal%20writs"},{"value":"territorial jurisdiction","formInput":"territorial%20jurisdiction"},{"value":"provisional certificate ","formInput":"provisional%20certificate%20"},{"value":"sec 120-b","formInput":"sec%20120-b"},{"value":"section 120","formInput":"section%20120"},{"value":"section 13(1)(d)(i)","formInput":"section%2013%281%29%28d%29%28i%29"},{"value":"420/467/468","formInput":"420/467/468"},{"value":"420 467","formInput":"420%20467"},{"value":"navinchandra n. majithia ","formInput":"navinchandra%20n.%20majithia%20"},{"value":"13(1)(d)","formInput":"13%281%29%28d%29"},{"value":"navinchandra n.","formInput":"navinchandra%20n."},{"value":"chief metropolitan magistrate","formInput":"chief%20metropolitan%20magistrate"},{"value":"navinchandra","formInput":"navinchandra"},{"value":"467","formInput":"467"}],"citeList":[{"tid":1128948,"url":null,"title":"Section 120 in The Indian Penal Code"},{"tid":556166,"url":null,"title":"Section 468 in The Indian Penal Code"},{"tid":1466184,"url":null,"title":"Section 471 in The Indian Penal Code"},{"tid":1436241,"url":null,"title":"Section 420 in The Indian Penal Code"},{"tid":1101716,"url":null,"title":"Section 13(1)(d) in The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988"}],"covers":[],"title":"Rajendra Ramchandra Kavalekar vs State Of Maharashtra & Anr on 23 January, 2009","publishdate":"2009-01-23","divtype":"judgments","citedbyList":[{"tid":1122881,"url":null,"title":"Vinugiri Motigiri vs State Of Gujarat [Alongwith ... on 20 July, 2001"},{"tid":24463327,"url":"http://judis.nic.in/Judis_Kolkata_App/list_new2.asp?Jud_Pdf_Name=CRA_359_2012_10062016_J_233.pdf","title":"Abul Kalam Khan & Anr vs The State Of West Bengal on 10 June, 2016"},{"tid":24057125,"url":"http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgst.aspx?filename=41139","title":"State Of Gujarat vs Kishanbhai on 7 January, 2014"},{"tid":41944252,"url":"http://lobis.nic.in/dhc/SRB/judgement/22-11-2012/SRB22112012CRLA9492010.pdf","title":"Mohd.

It is further assertion of the appellant that there is no\n\nreason for CBI, SPE, Ranchi to launch a case against the appellant in the\n\nyear 2004, of a case where inquiry had already been initiated by RCF Police\n\nStation for the very same offence and the matter is already pending before\n\nthe Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Kurla, Mumbai. Lastly, it is\n\nstated that the CBI, SPE, Ranchi has no jurisdiction to register a case\n\nagainst the appellant, since the entire cause of action had arisen in the State\n\nof Maharashtra and not in Ranchi and by registering a case at Ranchi by the\n\nCBI, SPE, Ranchi, have abused the process of law and it has no locus standi\n\nto file a complaint against the appellant in respect of the offences mentioned\n\nin the charge sheet in which the appellant is a victim by himself.\n\nAccordingly, he has sought for the following reliefs :\n\n</p><p id=\"p_4\">      1)        To issue a writ in the nature of writ of certiorari to quash\n\n                registration of the case R.C.

Case No. 1(A)/2004.      It is further contended that since the\n\npart of the cause of action has arisen in the State of Maharashtra, the High\n\nCourt of Judicature at Bombay has the jurisdiction to entertain the writ\n\npetition and grant relief sought for by the appellant.        In aid of his\n\nsubmission, learned senior counsel would invite our attention to the\n\nobservations made by this Court in the case of Navinchandra N. Majithia\n\nVs.

The learned counsel further submitted that the investigation in\n\nR.C. Case No. 1(A)/2004 is completed by the CBI, Ranchi and the\n\nchargesheet against the appellant and against Sri P.C. Ram, Despatch Clerk\n\nof Ranchi University has been filed before the Special Judge (CBI), Ranchi\n\nand the same is pending consideration.       Therefore, the learned counsel\n\nwould submit that the High Court of Judicature at Bombay was right in\n\ndeclining to entertain the Criminal Writ Petition filed by the appellant.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                                            7</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">\f9)    Having heard the learned counsels for the parties, in our view, the\n\nissue that requires our consideration is, whether the High Court of\n\nJudicature at Bombay was right in passing the impugned order rejecting the\n\nCriminal Writ Petition filed by the appellant on the ground, that, the Special\n\nJudge (CBI), Ranchi has heard case R.C. Case No. 1(A)/2004 and all the\n\ndocuments pertaining to the case are in the custody and possession of the\n\nSpecial Judge (CBI), Ranchi.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">10)       Before we advert to the issue raised for our consideration and\n\nconsequent decision, let us first notice the decision on which reliance is\n\nplaced by learned senior counsel Shri Tulsi in support of his submission.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">11)      The facts in Navinchandra N. Majithia Vs. State of Maharashtra's,\n\ncase was that the FIR was filed in Shillong, Meghalaya            against the\n\nappellant to reverse the transaction relating to transfer of company shares\n\nwhich had entirely taken place at Maharashtra. Therefore, the appellant had\n\nfiled a writ petition before the Mumbai High Court for quashing of FIR filed\n\nat Shillong and alternatively a prayer was made for the issue of Writ of\n\nMandamus against the State of Meghalaya for transfer of the investigation\n\nto the Mumbai Police. The High Court had dismissed the petition. In\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                                            8</span>\n\fappeal, this Court observed that the High Court has failed in not considering\n\nthe alternative prayer, since the part of the cause of action had arisen with\n\nthe territorial jurisdiction of the Bombay High Court.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">12)   It is also relevant to state, that, in Navinchandra N. Majithia's case,\n\nthe Court at paragraph 22 of the judgment has observed :\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">            \"So far as the question of territorial jurisdiction with\n      reference to a criminal offence is concerned the main factor to\n      be considered is the place where the alleged offence was\n      committed.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_18\">13)   The territorial jurisdiction of a court with regard to criminal offence\n\nwould be decided on the basis of place of occurrence of the incident and not\n\non the basis of where the complaint was filed and the mere fact that FIR was\n\nregistered in a particular State is not the sole criterion to decide that no\n\ncause of action has arisen even partly within the territorial limits of\n\njurisdiction of another court. The venue of enquiry or trial is primarily to be\n\ndetermined by the averments contained in the complaint or charge sheet.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1219882/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 177</a> of Criminal Procedure Code provides that every offence shall\n\nordinarily be inquired into and tried by a court within whose local\n\njurisdiction it was committed. Reference can be made to the observations\n\nmade by this court in\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                           9</span>\n\fAsit Bhattacharjee Vs. Hanuman Prasad Ojha and Ors. (2007) 5 SCC 786.\n\nThis court at paragraph 23 has stated as under :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">             \"The necessary ingredients for proving a criminal\n      offence must exist in a complaint petition. Such ingredients of\n      offence must be referable to the places where the cause of\n      action in regard to commission of offence has arisen. A cause\n      of action as understood in its ordinary parlance may be relevant\n      for exercise of jurisdiction under clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 226</a> of\n      the Constitution of India but its definition stricto sensu may not\n      be applicable for the purpose of bringing home a charge of\n      criminal offence. The application filed by the petitioner under\n      <a href=\"/doc/99487/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 156(3)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure disclosed\n      commission of a large number of offences. The fact that major\n      part of the offence took place outside the jurisdiction of the\n      Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Calcutta is not in dispute. But,\n      even if a part of the offence committed by the respondents\n      related to the petitioner Company was committed within the\n      jurisdiction of the said court, the High Court of Allahabad\n      should not have interfered in the matter.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"p_19\">14)   This court has further observed :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">      30) \"The High Court has placed strong reliance upon a\n      decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/777058/\" id=\"a_40\">Navinchandra N.

Considering the peculiar fact situation of\n            the case we are of the view that setting aside the\n            impugned judgment and remitting the case to the\n            High Court for fresh disposal will cause further delay\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                                                           10</span>\n\f            in investigation of the matter and may create other\n            complications.

Holdings Ltd. should be made by\n            Mumbai Police.'\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      31) This Court arrived at the finding that the High Court\n      should have issued a writ of mandamus directing the State of\n      Meghalaya to transfer the investigation to Mumbai Police\n      taking note of the averments made in the writ petition that the\n      complaint petition filed at Shillong was mala fide.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      32) No such explicit prayer was made by the respondents in\n      their writ petition, although a prayer for issuance of a writ in\n      the nature of mandamus, directing the State of West Bengal to\n      transfer Case No. 381 to the State of U.P. had been made. The\n      question of the State of West Bengal's having a legal duty in\n      that behalf did not arise. Only in the event an investigating\n      officer, having regard to the provisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/1980578/\" id=\"a_41\">Sections\n      154</a>, <a href=\"/doc/523607/\" id=\"a_42\">162</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1219882/\" id=\"a_43\">177</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1220064/\" id=\"a_44\">178</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure had\n      arrived at a finding that the alleged crime was not committed\n      within his territorial jurisdiction, could forward the first\n      information report to the police having jurisdiction in the\n      matter.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">      33) Stricto sensu, therefore, the High Court should not have\n      issued such a direction. Assuming, however, that the High\n      Court could mould the relief, in our opinion, it was not a case\n      where on the face of the allegations made in the complaint\n      petition, the same could be said to be mala fide. A major part\n      of the cause of action might have arisen in the State of U.P., but\n      the same by itself would not mean that the Calcutta Court had\n      no jurisdiction whatsoever.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_20\">15)   In the instant case, the CBI has initiated the suo-moto investigation\n\nagainst the appellant.   In the First Information Report filed before the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                                                           11</span>\n\fSpecial Judge (CBI), Ranchi, it is stated that during the course of\n\ninvestigation of R.C. Case No. 1(A)/2000, which was registered pursuant to\n\nthe orders of High Court of Jharkhand at Ranchi, a reliable source of\n\ninformation had been received to the effect that Shri Rajendra Ramchandra\n\nKavalekar (appellant) had entered into a criminal conspiracy with the other\n\nunknown persons including the officials of Ranchi University during the\n\nacademic year 1993-94 by obtaining the false and forged mark sheets of\n\nRanchi University,       and, further, on the strength of those false and\n\nfabricated documents pertaining to his graduation degree, fraudulently and\n\ndishonestly   obtained    employment     in   India    Tourism   Development\n\nCorporation as Cashier-cum-Sales Assistant.           In the First Information\n\nReport, it is also stated that the appellant in collusion with the officials of\n\nIndia Tourism Development Corporation Ltd., Mumbai, the University, had\n\nmanaged to suppress letter dated 26.2.2000 written by the Controller of\n\nExamination, Ranchi pursuant to the queries made by the Manager\n\n(Vigilance) of ITDC, for ascertaining whether the provisional certificate\n\nand the degree certificate issued to the appellant for the academic year\n\n1993-94 is forged and fake, and the appellant with a collusion             and\n\nconnivance of the officials of the University had got prepared a letter dated\n\n26.2.2000, wherein it is stated that the marks sheets, provisional certificate\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                                           12</span>\n\fand the degree certificate produced by the appellant at the time of securing\n\nthe job in ITDC is correct and genuine and thereby has committed a\n\ncriminal offence under the provisions<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_45\"> of Indian Penal Code</a>.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">16)   The case of the appellant before the High Court of Mumbai, was that\n\nhe was nowhere responsible for the issuance of fake/forged degree\n\ncertificates while securing job as Cashier-cum-Sales Assistant in ITDC.\n\nAccording to appellant, it is the handiwork of Shri Kanhayalal Sharma, who\n\nwas managing the institution known as `Marudhar Mahavidyalaya' having\n\nits centres at Pune and Mumbai. Except this bald assertion, he has not\n\nproduced any material in support of that assertion.         However, in the\n\ncomplaint filed by CBI, Ranchi, it is specifically alleged that the appellant\n\nhad entered into criminal conspiracy with the officials of the Ranchi\n\nUniversity and had obtained fake degree certificates. A court trying an\n\naccused for an offence of conspiracy is competent to try him for all offences\n\ncommitted in pursuance of conspiracy irrespective of the fact that any or all\n\nthe other offences were not committed within the territorial jurisdiction (See\n\nBanwarilal Jhunjhunwala vs. Union of India, AIR 1963 SC 1620).\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                                          13</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">\f17)   A bare perusal of the complaint filed would clearly go to show that\n\nthe cause of action arose within the jurisdiction of Special Judge (CBI),\n\nRanchi, the investigation is completed in Ranchi, all the records and the\n\ndocuments pertaining to complaint and the charge sheet are before the\n\nSpecial Judge (CBI), Ranchi, and therefore, in our considered view, the\n\nHigh Court of Judicature at Bombay was perfectly justified in declining to\n\nentertain the Writ Petition filed by the petitioner.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">18)   In view of the above reasons, we reject the appeal.

Leave granted.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">2.    Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the\n\nGujarat High Court upholding the conviction of the appellant for offences\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_1\">Sections 306</a> and <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_2\">498-A</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860\n\n(in short the `<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_3\">IPC</a>') and <a href=\"/doc/751411/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 3</a> of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 (in\n\nshort `DP Act'). Learned Additional Sessions Judge, Court No.9,\n\fAhmedabad City imposed sentences of 3 years, 10 years and 5 years\n\nrespectively for the aforesaid offences and fine of Rs.5,000/-, Rs.20,000/-\n\nand Rs.20,000/- with default stipulations.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">3.    Prosecution version in a nutshell is as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">      The accused married Kantaben (hereinafter referred to as the\n\n`deceased') in 1989. Soon after two years of his marriage, the accused\n\nstarted inflicting mental and physical torture on her and she was taunted by\n\nthe accused for not bringing sufficient dowry in the marriage. He also\n\ndemanded from the victim an amount of Rs.40,000/- for the purpose of\n\npurchasing a house. He even wrote letters to the in-laws and demanded\n\nRs.40,000/- for purchasing the house. The demand was persistent. Even\n\nthreats were administered to the deceased and her family members. Thus,\n\nthe accused inflicted mental and physical torture on the victim which\n\nprompted her to commit suicide by burning herself on 23-03-1999 after\n\npouring kerosene on her body. Thus, as per the prosecution case, the\n\nappellant has committed the offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 498A</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_6\">306</a> IPC read with Sections 3 and 7 of DP Act.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                    2</span>\n\f      The complaint was given by Dhulagiri Gumangiri Goswami on\n\n17.5.1999. On the strength of the complaint given by the complainant\n\ninvestigation was carried out. The place where the suicide was committed\n\nby the victim was visited and the panchnama of the place of incident was\n\nprepared in the presence of the panch-witnesses. Statements of the witnesses\n\nfrom the neighbourhood were recorded. The injured was immediately\n\nrushed to the hospital for providing necessary treatment. Muddamal seized\n\nwas sent to Forensic Science Laboratory for the purpose of detailed\n\nanalysis. On the death of the victim, the inquest panchnama was prepared\n\nand the dead body was sent for autopsy. The appellant was arrested during\n\nthe course of investigation. On receipt of the report from FSL, the post-\n\nmortem report along with other material, the appellant was charge-sheeted\n\nfor the offences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_7\">Sections 498A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_8\">306</a> of IPC as well as\n\nSections 3 and 7 of the DP Act. He was produced before the Metropolitan\n\nMagistrate, Ahmedabad, who in turn committed the case to the Sessions\n\nCourt under <a href=\"/doc/887219/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 209</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short\n\nthe `Code') as the case was exclusively triable by the Sessions Court.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">      As the accused persons pleaded innocence trial was held. Seventeen\n\nwitnesses were examined to further the prosecution version. The trial court\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                    3</span>\n\ffound that the letters written by the accused clearly established the demand\n\nof dowry and further the suicide was clearly abetted by the acts and conduct\n\nof the appellant. Accordingly, the conviction was recorded and sentences\n\nwere imposed as afore-stated.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">      In appeal, the High court concurred with the views of the trial Court.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">4.    In support of the appeal, it was submitted that the letters whereby the\n\nalleged demand of dowry was made has not been signed by the appellant\n\nand even has not been addressed to anyone. There was no material to show\n\nthat the appellant had subjected the deceased to such cruelty and harassment\n\nas to instigate her to commit suicide. The evidence on record shows that the\n\nappellant had purchased valuable silver ornaments for the deceased and in\n\nhis insurance policy, the deceased was shown to be his nominee. Their\n\nrelation was otherwise cordial. Since the substratum of the allegations of\n\ndowry and harassment were letters, their authenticity having not been\n\nestablished the trial Court and the High Court should not have relied upon\n\nthe same.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                    4</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">\f5.    It is pointed out that the accused himself had taken the deceased to\n\nthe hospital and from his conduct it clearly shows that the accused was not\n\nguilty. In essence, it is submitted that the commission of alleged offences\n\nhas not been established by the prosecution.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_17\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">6.    In response, learned counsel for the respondent-State supported the\n\njudgment.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_19\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">7.    We shall first deal with the plea relating to applicability of <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_10\">Section\n\n306</a> IPC.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_21\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">8.    <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 306</a> IPC deals with abetment of suicide. The said provision\n\nreads as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_23\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">            \"306 ABETMENT OF SUICIDE.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">            If any person commits suicide, whoever abets the\n            commission of such suicide, shall be punished with\n            imprisonment of either description for a term which may\n            extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p_24\">9.    Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or\n\nintentionally aiding that person in doing of a thing. In cases of conspiracy\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                    5</span>\n\falso it would involve that mental process of entering into conspiracy for the\n\ndoing of that thing. More active role which can be described as instigating\n\nor aiding the doing of a thing it required before a person can be said to be\n\nabetting the commission of offence under <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 306</a> of IPC.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_25\">10.   <a href=\"/doc/337402/\" id=\"a_13\">In State of West Bengal v. Orilal Jaiswal</a> (AIR 1994 SC 1418) this\n\nCourt has observed that the courts should be extremely careful in assessing\n\nthe facts and circumstances of each case and the evidence adduced in the\n\ntrial for the purpose of finding whether the cruelty meted out to the victim\n\nhad in fact induced her to end her life by committing suicide. If it transpires\n\nto the Court that a victim committing suicide was hypersensitive to ordinary\n\npetulance, discord and differences in domestic life quite common to the\n\nsociety to which the victim belonged and such petulance discord and\n\ndifferences were not expected to induce a similarly circumstanced\n\nindividual in a given society to commit suicide, the conscience of the Court\n\nshould not be satisfied for basing a finding that the accused charged of\n\nabetting the offence of suicide should be found guilty.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_26\">11.   <a href=\"/doc/1667403/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 107</a> IPC defines abetment of a thing. The offence of abetment\n\nis a separate and distinct offence provided in the Act as an offence. A\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                     6</span>\n\fperson, abets the doing of a thing when (1) he instigates any person to do\n\nthat thing; or (2) engages with one or more other persons in any conspiracy\n\nfor the doing of that thing; or (3) intentionally aids, by act or illegal\n\nomission, the doing of that thing. These things are essential to complete\n\nabetment as a crime. The word \"instigate\" literally means to provoke, incite,\n\nurge on or bring about by persuasion to do any thing. The abetment may be\n\nby instigation, conspiracy or intentional aid, as provided in the three clauses\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/1763444/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 107</a>. <a href=\"/doc/1763444/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 109</a> provides that if the act abetted is committed in\n\nconsequence of abetment and there is no provision for the punishment of\n\nsuch abetment, then the offender is to be punished with the punishment\n\nprovided for the original offence. 'Abetted' in <a href=\"/doc/1763444/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 109</a> means the\n\nspecific offence abetted. Therefore, the offence for the abetment of which a\n\nperson is charged with the abetment is normally linked with the proved\n\noffence\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_27\">12.   In cases of alleged abetment of suicide there must be proof of direct\n\nor indirect acts of incitement to the commission of suicide. The mere fact\n\nthat the husband treated the deceased-wife with cruelty is not enough. [<a href=\"/doc/1214258/\" id=\"a_18\">See\n\nMahinder Singh v. State of M.P</a>. (1995 AIR SCW 4570)].\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                     7</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_28\">\f13.   The aforesaid aspects were highlighted in <a href=\"/doc/621485/\" id=\"a_19\">Kishori Lal v. State of M.P</a>.\n\n(2007 (10) SCC 797), <a href=\"/doc/1310174/\" id=\"a_20\">Randhir Singh and Anr. v. State of Punjab</a> (2004 (13)\n\nSCC 129) and Criminal Appeal No. 1464 of 2007 (<a href=\"/doc/21622/\" id=\"a_21\">Sohan Raj Sharma v.\n\nState of Haryana</a> disposed of on April 7, 2008).\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_29\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_30\">14.   The conviction so far as it relates to <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 306</a> IPC, therefore,\n\ncannot be sustained in view of the background facts and is set aside. But the\n\nmaterials on record particularly the letters on which specific emphasis has\n\nbeen led by the trial Court and the High Court amply demonstrate the\n\ncommission of offences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 498-A</a> IPC and Section 3\n\nof DP Act. The convictions are sustained. But the sentence in respect of\n\nSection 3 of DP Act is reduced to three years.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_31\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_32\">15.

Clause (2) of the\n\fagreement stipulated the price of the house to be Rs.139,215/40. After\n\ndeducting the payment of Rs.37,415/- made by the lessee towards the\n\nprice (on 29.6.1990), it permitted the lessee to pay the balance of\n\nRs.101,800/40 in 52 quarterly instalments of Rs.1957/70 each commencing\n\nfrom 1.9.1989. The said clause gave the option to the Lessee to convert\n\nthe lease into a sale on completion of payment of all the instalments\n\nby paying a commitment charge of Rs.200/-. Clause (3) of the agreement\n\nrequired the lessee to pay an annual rent of Rs.24/90 during the period\n\nof   lease   commencing   from   1.9.1989.   Clause   (6)   of   the   agreement\n\nstipulated that in the event of default in paying any instalment or\n\nother dues on the due date, the lessee shall pay interest at the rate\n\nof 15% per annum on the defaulted instalments/dues from the date when\n\nthe same fell due.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">3.      On execution of the Lease-cum-Sale Agreement, the respondent\n\ntook possession of the house on 9.5.1991 and commenced paying the\n\ninstalments from June, 1991. He paid the last 12 instalments (No.41 to\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">52) in a lump sum on 5.7.2001. The appellant by letter dated 1.12.2001\n\ninformed the respondent that he was still due in a sum of Rs.57,175/-.\n\nOn 27.12.2001, the respondent applied to the appellant for execution\n\nand registration of a sale deed claiming that he had paid all the\n\ninstalments. The appellant sent a reply dated 30.1.2002 informing the\n\nrespondent that until the sum of Rs.57,175/- which was due was paid,\n\nthe sale deed could not be executed. A calculation sheet showing how\n\nRs.57,175/- was found to be due was also furnished.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">4.      Feeling   aggrieved,     the   respondent   approached   the    District\n\fConsumer Forum, Khurda alleging deficiency of service. He sought a\n\ndirection to the appellant to execute the sale deed without insisting\n\nupon    the    payment         of   Rs.57,175/-.        He    also   claimed      Rs.60,000/-        as\n\ncompensation from the appellant. The District Forum by the order dated\n\n27.10.2003 dismissed the complaint holding that refusal to execute a\n\nsale deed until the amount due was paid, was not a deficiency in\n\nservice.      The    respondent       filed    an     appeal    before     the    State      Consumer\n\nDisputes Redressal Commission, Cuttack. The State Commission by its\n\norder dated 21.12.2006 allowed the appeal in part and directed the\n\nrespondent to pay a lump sum of Rs.20,000/- to the appellant in full\n\nand final settlement of the dues and directed the appellant to execute\n\nthe sale deed on receipt of such amount. The appellant filed a revision\n\nbefore the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi,\n\nchallenging         the   reduction      in    the    amount    payable,     as    arbitrary        and\n\ncontrary to the terms of contract. The National Commission dismissed\n\nthe    revision      by    a    short    order       dated    8.5.2007     observing         that   the\n\nappellant could not charge compound interest and therefore, the order\n\nof the State Commission was just and equitable and did not call for\n\ninterference. Feeling aggrieved the appellant has filed this appeal by\n\nspecial leave.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">5.       The appellant contends that it charged interest strictly in\n\naccordance with the terms of the lease agreement. It contends that\n\ncharging      of     interest       at   the     rate    of    15%   per    annum       on    delayed\n\ninstalments in terms of clause (6) of the agreement was not illegal.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">6.       We find considerable force in the submission of the appellant.\n\nThe    lease-cum-sale           agreement      shows     the    `price'     of    the     house      as\n\fRs.139,215/40. After adjusting Rs.37,415/- paid by the respondent, the\n\nbalance of Rs.101,800/40 was made payable in 52 quarterly instalments\n\ncommencing from 1.9.1989. There is no requirement to pay interest, if\n\nthe    instalments       were    paid    on   the   due        dates.    Only    if     the   lessee\n\ncommitted default in paying any instalment or other dues, interest at\n\n15%    per    annum      was     payable      by    the        lessee,    on      the    defaulted\n\ninstalments/dues from the date of default to date of payment under\n\nclause 6 of the agreement. Even when there was default, neither the\n\ninstalments       that    were    already      paid       on    the     due     dates,    nor    the\n\ninstalments which were yet to fall due, were subjected to interest\n\nunder clause (6) of the agreement. Charging interest under clause (6)\n\nfrom the date of default to date of payment on the defaulted amount is\n\nunexceptionable and does not amount to charging of compound interest as\n\nwrongly assumed by the State Commission and National Commission.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">6.       Even if we assume that the price of Rs.139,215.40 stipulated in\n\nthe lease-cum-sale agreement included, in addition to the cost of the\n\nplot and the construction of the house, interest thereon, the position\n\nwill   be    no   different.      Each     equated    instalment          would    then       have   a\n\nprincipal component and interest component. As the equated instalments\n\nwould include interest on the principal only up to the due date of\n\ninstalment, whenever there is a default, there can be no dispute that\n\nthe `principal' part of the instalment could be subjected to interest\n\nfrom the date of default to date of payment. It is no doubt true that\n\nwhen the defaulted instalment in entirety is subjected to interest, the\n\n`interest' component of the defaulted instalment is also subjected to\n\ninterest. To that limited extent, there may be charging of interest\n\nupon interest. Charging of such interest, on the interest part of the\n\finstalment, on default in payment of the instalment, at a reasonable\n\nrate from the date of default, cannot be termed as charging of compound\n\ninterest in regard to the entire dues. It is only a provision to ensure\n\nthat the dues (instalments) are paid promptly and avoid misuse of the\n\nconcession given by permitting payment in instalments. But for such a\n\nprovision, lessees/allottees who have already been given possession,\n\nwill   be   tempted        to   delay          payments,       thereby      leading     to    continuous\n\ndefaults. A statutory development authority, working on no profit no\n\nloss   basis,       can   ill       afford      to     permit       such   continuous        defaults   by\n\nlessees/allottees, which will paralyse their very functioning, thereby\n\naffecting future developmental activities for the benefit of other\n\nmembers of the general public. Therefore a provision for interest as\n\ncontained      in    clause     6     of       the    lease-cum-sale         agreement       is   neither\n\ninequitable nor in terrorem. Where the basic rate of interest is itself\n\nvery high, or where interest is charged on the entire price instead of\n\ncharging interest on the reducing balance, when working out the equated\n\ninstalments, or where the rate of interest on default is punitively\n\nexcessive, the position may be different. But no such case is made out\n\nby the respondent.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">7.       If the facts are examined, it becomes evident that the sum of\n\nRs.57,175/-     was       not   due       on    account        of   charging     compound      interest.\n\nThough   the    allotment           was    made       on   1.5.1991        and   the    lease-cum-sale\n\nagreement was signed on 6.5.1991, clause (2) of the lease-cum-sale\n\nagreement    contained          a    rather          unusual    condition        that   the    quarterly\n\ninstalment of Rs.1957/70 would commence from 1.9.1989, which is a date\n\n28 months prior to the date of allotment and lease-cum-sale agreement.\n\nThe reason for such a provision was that the last date for applications\n\fand allotment of houses under the scheme had expired in the year 1989\n\nand the allotment rate of the house had been worked out with reference\n\nto 1989. The respondent had applied belatedly on 29.6.1990 and in the\n\nnormal     course,   would      not   have   obtained   any    allotment.   In     fact,\n\nappellant, by letter dated 19.12.1990, informed the respondent that no\n\nhouse was available for allotment. But subsequently, when some houses\n\nunder the MIG scheme became available on account of default or other\n\nreason, the appellant issued an letter dated 1.5.1991 to the respondent\n\nallotting MIG House No.M-19. Having regarding to the terms of the\n\nscheme, it became necessary to require the lessee to pay the earnest\n\nmoney deposit and the instalments with reference to the original date\n\nstipulated for allotment, namely, 1.9.1989. Therefore, when the lease-\n\ncum-sale     agreement    was     executed    on   6.5.1991,    the   respondent     was\n\nrequired to pay the original allotment price in quarterly instalments\n\nof Rs.1957/70 with effect from 1.9.1989 to avoid revising the allotment\n\nprice. This meant that when the agreement was executed on 6.5.1991, the\n\nrespondent had to pay the initial payment and instalments which had\n\nfallen due between 1.9.1989 and 6.5.1991 and also pay the interest\n\nthereon at 15% per annum from the respective due dates, under clause\n\n(6). But the respondent started paying the quarterly instalments of\n\nRs.1957/70 as if such instalments commenced prospectively only after\n\nthe agreement dated 6.5.1991, and not from 1.9.1989. He paid the first\n\ninstalment only on 25.6.1991. There was thus an accumulated default in\n\nregard to the payments due between 1.9.1989 and 6.5.1991 on which\n\ninterest was payable under clause (6). There were also some delay in\n\npaying the subsequent instalments. If the Development Authority charged\n\ninterest    for   the    defaulted/delayed     instalments,     in    accordance    with\n\nclause (6) of the lease-cum-sale agreement, the respondent could not\n\fobject to the same. We are therefore of the view that the orders of the\n\nState Commission and National Commission are not justified.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">8.       The     case   of    the    respondent       in    its    complaint     was   that   the\n\ninterest could not be charged from September, 1989 as the allotment was\n\nmade    only   on    1.5.1991       followed    by   the    lease-cum-sale        agreement   on\n\n6.5.1991 and delivery of possession on 9.5.1991. He also contended that\n\nthere was no provision for payment of any interest by the lessee as\n\nclause (6) of the agreement was applicable only in the event of default\n\nand he had not committed any default. It should be noted that the\n\nrespondent did not protest against the provisions of clauses (2) and\n\n(6) of the lease-cum-sale agreement requiring payment of instalments\n\nwith effect from 1.9.1989 and took possession of the house in terms of\n\nthe said agreement. Therefore, he could not be heard to say that the\n\ninstalments      should      commence    only    prospectively.          The    District   Forum\n\nrightly held that charging of interest by the appellant from 1.9.1989\n\nin accordance with clause (6) of the agreement and insisting upon\n\npayment of dues before executing the sale deed, did not amount to\n\ndeficiency in service. But the State Commission and National Commission\n\nacted    on    wrong    assumptions.      Further,         any    fora   under   the   <a href=\"/doc/1733066/\" id=\"a_1\">Consumer\n\nProtection Act</a>, 1986 (`Act' for short) before granting any relief to a\n\ncomplainant, should be satisfied                that the complaint relates to any of\n\nthe    matters      specified    in    <a href=\"/doc/334666/\" id=\"a_2\">section       2(c)</a>    of    the   Act,    and   that   the\n\ncomplainant has alleged and made out either unfair or restrictive trade\n\npractice by a trader, or defects in the goods sold, or any deficiency\n\nin a service rendered, or charging of excessive price for the goods\n\nsold, or offering of any goods hazardous to life and safety without\n\ndisplaying information regarding contents etc. If none of these is\n\falleged and made out, the complaint will have to be rejected. When a\n\nlessee signs without protest an agreement agreeing to pay interest at a\n\ngiven rate from a given date in given circumstances, and does not\n\ncontend that the term relating to instalments or interest is invalid or\n\ninequitable, it is not open to the consumer forum to grant any relief.\n\nA demand for any amount due in terms of the unchallenged terms of an\n\nagreement, does not furnish a cause of action to the lessee/allottee to\n\napproach the consumer forum.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">9.     Consequently, we allow this appeal, set aside the orders of the\n\nState Commission and National Commission and restore the order of the\n\nDistrict Forum. We, however, make it clear that on payment of the\n\nbalance amount due, the appellant shall execute the sale deed, if it is\n\nnot already executed.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_18\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">                                                    _________________J.\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">                                                     [R.

Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by the National\n\nConsumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi, (in short the\n\n`National Commission').\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">3.   Background facts in a nutshell are as follows:\n\f      Respondent was the owner of a vehicle- a Maruti van which was the\n\nsubject matter of insurance with the present appellant for a period from\n\n27.1.2003 to 26.1.2004. The Vehicle in question met with an accident on\n\n12.6.2003 and was badly damaged. The estimate of the cost of repair was\n\nprepared by Automobiles Satya of Bilaspur. According to him the estimated\n\nexpenditure on total repair of the vehicle was Rs.2,00,000/-. Intimation of\n\nthe same was given by the complainant to the present appellant and claim\n\nwas made. The same was rejected on the ground that the driver of the\n\nvehicle did not possess a valid driving licence and the vehicle which was a\n\nprivate vehicle was insured for personal use, but was being used as a taxi for\n\ncarrying marriage parties. a marriage party was being transported in the\n\nvehicle after charging rent of Rs.2100/- when the accident occurred. The\n\ndriver did not possess a valid licence and, therefore, the vehicle was being\n\nplied against the terms of the insurance policy. The District Consumer\n\nDisputes Redressal Forum Sarguja, Ambikapur Chhattisgarh, rejected the\n\nclaim petition. An appeal was preferred before the State Consumer Dispute\n\nRedressal Commission, Rajpur (in short the `State Commission'). By order\n\ndated 17.10.2005, the appeal was allowed. It was held that it would be\n\nproper to declare the claim of complainant as \"Non-standard\" consequent to\n\nthe violation and breach. Therefore, the present appellant was directed to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                     2</span>\n\fpay Rs.90,000/- i.e. 75% of Rs.1,20,000/- i.e. the amount assessed by the\n\nsurveyor of the insurance company along with 9% interest. The only reason\n\ngiven by the State Commission was that even if the vehicle was being used\n\nas a taxi, there was no fundamental breach of the terms of the policy. A\n\nrevision petition was filed before the National Commission which came to\n\nbe dismissed by the impugned order. The National Commission held that\n\neven though the vehicle was being used as a commercial vehicle and the\n\ndriver did not have a valid driving licence, there was no fundamental breach\n\nof the terms of the policy.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">      According to the appellant the insured vehicle was being used as a\n\ncommercial vehicle, and the driver of the vehicle is required to hold an\n\nappropriate licence. If the driver who was driving the vehicle at a relevant\n\npoint of time did not possess any licence to drive a commercial vehicle,\n\nthere is a breach of the conditions of the policy and such plea was available\n\nto be raised as a defence.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">4.    This Court in <a href=\"/doc/1827019/\" id=\"a_1\">National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Swaran Singh</a> [2004(3)\n\nSCC 297] clearly laid down that the liability of the Insurance Company vis-\n\n`-vis the owner would depend upon several factors. The owner would be\n\nliable for payment of compensation in a case where the driver was not\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                    3</span>\n\fhaving a licence at all. It was the obligation on the part of the owner to take\n\nadequate care to see that the driver had an appropriate licence to drive the\n\nvehicle. The question as regards the liability of the owner vis-`-vis the\n\ndriver being not possessed of a valid licence was considered in Swaran\n\nSingh's case stating:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">               \"89. Section 3 of the Act casts an obligation on a driver\n           to hold an effective driving licence for the type of vehicle\n           which he intends to drive. Section 10 of the Act enables\n           the Central Government to prescribe forms of driving\n           licences for various categories of vehicles mentioned in\n           sub-section (2) of the said section. The various types of\n           vehicles described for which a driver may obtain a licence\n           for one or more of them are: (a) motorcycle without gear,\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">           (b) motorcycle with gear, (c) invalid carriage, (d) light\n           motor vehicle, (e) transport vehicle, (f) road roller, and (g)\n           motor vehicle of other specified description. The\n           definition clause in Section 2 of the Act defines various\n           categories of vehicles which are covered in broad types\n           mentioned in sub-section (2) of Section 10. They are\n           `goods carriage', `heavy goods vehicle', `heavy passenger\n           motor vehicle', `invalid carriage', `light motor vehicle',\n           `maxi-cab', `medium goods vehicle', `medium passenger\n           motor vehicle', `motor-cab', `motorcycle', `omnibus',\n           `private service vehicle', `semi-trailer', `tourist vehicle',\n           `tractor', `trailer' and `transport vehicle'. In claims for\n           compensation for accidents, various kinds of breaches\n           with regard to the conditions of driving licences arise for\n           consideration before the Tribunal as a person possessing a\n           driving licence for `motorcycle without gear', [sic may be\n           driving a vehicle] for which he has no licence. Cases may\n           also arise where a holder of driving licence for `light\n           motor vehicle' is found to be driving a `maxi-cab', `motor-</blockquote><p id=\"p_13\">\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">           cab' or `omnibus' for which he has no licence. In each\n           case, on evidence led before the Tribunal, a decision has to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                     4</span>\n\f           be taken whether the fact of the driver possessing licence\n           for one type of vehicle but found driving another type of\n           vehicle, was the main or contributory cause of accident. If\n           on facts, it is found that the accident was caused solely\n           because of some other unforeseen or intervening causes\n           like mechanical failures and similar other causes having\n           no nexus with the driver not possessing requisite type of\n           licence, the insurer will not be allowed to avoid its liability\n           merely for technical breach of conditions concerning\n           driving licence.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">5.    The matter came up for consideration again before this Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/208337/\" id=\"a_2\">National Insurance Corpn. Ltd. v. Kanti Devi</a> [2005 (5) )SCC 789] wherein\n\nthis Court upon consideration of the observations made in Swaran Singh's\n\ncase opined:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_17\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                  \"12.

Therefore, we think it\n               proper to remit the matter to MACT for fresh\n               consideration. It shall permit the parties to lead such\n               further evidence as they may intend to lead.

In\n\naddition to that the vehicle which was insured for personal use was used for\n\ncommercial purposes.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_23\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_24\">10.

The appellant was\n\nconvicted by learned First Additional Sessions Judge, Bhind, for offence\n\npunishable under Section 302 read with Section 109 or in the alternative\n\funder Section 302 read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 34</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in\n\nshort the `<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a>'). He was sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">3.    The High Court by the impugned judgment altered the conviction to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_3\">section 304</a> Part I IPC read with <a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_4\">Sections 109</a> and <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_5\">34</a> IPC. He was sentenced\n\nto undergo imprisonment for 5 years and to pay a fine of Rs.20,000/- with\n\ndefault stipulation.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">4.    Prosecution version in a nutshell is as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">      Report Ex.P/1 was lodged by complainant Lakhansingh (PW1)\n\naccording to which on 31.5.1990 his cousin Pappu had some altercation\n\nwith Kanthshree (DW1), sister-in-law of appellant. Due to that incident\n\nwhen on 1.6.1990 at 6.00 a.m. Pappu was going to answer call of nature, he\n\nwas surrounded by appellant Ranveer Singh and his son Munnu alias\n\nPrithviraj and   was thrashed to ground. When he shouted, complainant\n\nLakhansingh (PW 1), Vasudev (P.W.3) and Vrindawan (PW 3) reached the\n\nspot alongwith Lalita alias Firki (hereinafter referred to as the `deceased'),\n\nsister of the complainant Lakhansingh and his cousin Sunil (PW8). Seeing\n\nthem, appellant asked his son Prithviraj alias Munnu to bring his licensed\n\nrifle from the home. Prithviraj alias Munnu brought the gun from the house.\n\nOn exhortation of the present appellant, Munnu fired a gun shot which\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                     2</span>\n\fcaused injury to Lalita on the left thigh. Lalita was taken to the hospital in a\n\nbullock cart but on the way she succumbed to the injury sustained by her.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">      Report of the incident was lodged on 1.6.1990 at about 7 A.M. at\n\npolice station Dehat, Bhind. On the basis of the report lodged by\n\nLakhansingh (PW 1), police registered a criminal case against the present\n\nappellant and his son Prithviraj alias Munnu. Said Prithviraj alias Munnu\n\nbeing a minor, his case was referred to the Juvenile Court. So far as the\n\npresent appellant is concerned, the matter was investigated by the police and\n\nchallan was filed against him. The case was committed to the Court of\n\nSessions for trial. The Sessions Court recorded the evidence and after\n\nappreciating the evidence convicted and sentenced the present appellant as\n\nindicated hereinabove. An appeal was preferred before the High Court.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">      Before the High Court the basic stand was that the accused had\n\nexercised the right of private defence and, therefore, no offence was made\n\nout. The High Court held that even if the right of private defence is accepted\n\nto be available at some point of time, it was exceeded and, therefore, the\n\nappropriate conviction was under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 304</a> Part II IPC.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                     3</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">\f5.    Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the appellant is\n\nclearly protected because he was exercising the right of private defence.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">6.    Learned counsel for the State on the other hand supported the\n\njudgment.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">7.    Only question which needs to be considered is the alleged exercise of\n\nright of private defence. <a href=\"/doc/777353/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 96</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_8\">IPC</a> provides that nothing is an offence\n\nwhich is done in the exercise of the right of private defence. The Section\n\ndoes not define the expression `right of private defence'. It merely indicates\n\nthat nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of such right.\n\nWhether in a particular set of circumstances, a person legitimately acted in\n\nthe exercise of the right of private defence is a question of fact to be\n\ndetermined on the facts and circumstances of each case. No test in the\n\nabstract for determining such a question can be laid down. In determining\n\nthis question of fact, the Court must consider all the surrounding\n\ncircumstances. It is not necessary for the accused to plead in so many words\n\nthat he acted in self-defence. If the circumstances show that the right of\n\nprivate defence was legitimately exercised, it is open to the Court to\n\nconsider such a plea. In a given case the Court can consider it even if the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                     4</span>\n\faccused has not taken it, if the same is available to be considered from the\n\nmaterial on record. Under <a href=\"/doc/429611/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 105</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (in\n\nshort `the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_10\">Evidence Act</a>'), the burden of proof is on the accused, who sets up\n\nthe plea of self-defence, and, in the absence of proof, it is not possible for\n\nthe Court to presume the truth of the plea of self-defence. The Court shall\n\npresume the absence of such circumstances. It is for the accused to place\n\nnecessary material on record either by himself adducing positive evidence\n\nor by eliciting necessary facts from the witnesses examined for the\n\nprosecution. An accused taking the plea of the right of private defence is not\n\nnecessarily required to call evidence; he can establish his plea by reference\n\nto circumstances transpiring from the prosecution evidence itself.        The\n\nquestion in such a case would be a question of assessing the true effect of\n\nthe prosecution evidence, and not a question of the accused discharging any\n\nburden. Where the right of private defence is pleaded, the defence must be\n\na reasonable and probable version satisfying the Court that the harm caused\n\nby the accused was necessary for either warding off the attack or for\n\nforestalling the further reasonable apprehension from the side of the\n\naccused. The burden of establishing the plea of self-defence is on the\n\naccused and the burden stands discharged by showing preponderance of\n\nprobabilities in favour of that plea on the basis of the material on record.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                     5</span>\n\f(<a href=\"/doc/1479705/\" id=\"a_11\">See Munshi Ram and Ors. v. Delhi Administration</a> (AIR 1968 SC 702),\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1660698/\" id=\"a_12\">State of Gujarat v. Bai Fatima</a> (AIR 1975 SC 1478), <a href=\"/doc/853570/\" id=\"a_13\">State of U.P. v.

If a person has a right of private defence of\n\nbody under <a href=\"/doc/290452/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 97</a>, that right extends under <a href=\"/doc/1942836/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 100</a> to causing\n\ndeath if there is reasonable apprehension that death or grievous hurt would\n\nbe the consequence of the assault. The oft quoted observation of this Court\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/1344060/\" id=\"a_19\">Salim Zia v. State of U.P</a>. (AIR 1979 SC 391), runs as follows:\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                    \"It is true that the burden on an accused person to\n             establish the plea of self-defence is not as onerous as the\n             one which lies on the prosecution and that, while the\n             prosecution is required to prove its case beyond\n             reasonable doubt, the accused need not establish the plea\n             to the hilt and may discharge his onus by establishing a\n             mere preponderance of probabilities either by laying\n             basis for that plea in the cross-examination of the\n             prosecution witnesses or by adducing defence\n             evidence.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p_17\">8.    The accused need not prove the existence of the right of private\n\ndefence beyond reasonable doubt. It is enough for him to show as in a civil\n\ncase that the preponderance of probabilities is in favour of his plea.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                     6</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">\f9.    A plea of right of private defence cannot be based on surmises and\n\nspeculation. While considering whether the right of private defence is\n\navailable to an accused, it is not relevant whether he may have a chance to\n\ninflict severe and mortal injury on the aggressor. In order to find whether\n\nthe right of private defence is available to an accused, the entire incident\n\nmust be examined with care and viewed in its proper setting. <a href=\"/doc/290452/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 97</a>\n\ndeals with the subject matter of right of private defence. The plea of right of\n\nself defence may relate to the body or property (i) of the person exercising\n\nthe right; or (ii) of any other person; and the right may be exercised in the\n\ncase of any offence against the body, and in the case of offences of theft,\n\nrobbery, mischief or criminal trespass, and attempts at such offences in\n\nrelation to property. <a href=\"/doc/1358156/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 99</a> lays down the limits of the right of private\n\ndefence. <a href=\"/doc/850208/\" id=\"a_22\">Sections 96</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1300329/\" id=\"a_23\">98</a> give a right of private defence against certain\n\noffences and acts. The right given under <a href=\"/doc/850208/\" id=\"a_24\">Sections 96</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1300329/\" id=\"a_25\">98</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1942836/\" id=\"a_26\">100</a> to <a href=\"/doc/697566/\" id=\"a_27\">106</a> is\n\ncontrolled by <a href=\"/doc/1358156/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 99</a>. To claim a right of private defence extending to\n\nvoluntary causing of death, the accused must show that there were\n\ncircumstances giving rise to reasonable grounds for apprehending that either\n\ndeath or grievous hurt would be caused to him. The burden is on the\n\naccused to show that he had a right of private defence which extended to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                     7</span>\n\fcausing of death. <a href=\"/doc/1942836/\" id=\"a_29\">Sections 100</a> and <a href=\"/doc/147127/\" id=\"a_30\">101</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_31\">IPC</a> define the limit and extent of\n\nright of private defence.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_19\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">10.   <a href=\"/doc/1505766/\" id=\"a_32\">Sections 102</a> and <a href=\"/doc/429611/\" id=\"a_33\">105</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_34\">IPC</a> deal with commencement and continuance\n\nof the right of private defence of body and property respectively. The right\n\ncommences, as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body\n\narises from an attempt, or threat, to commit the offence, although the\n\noffence may not have been committed but not until there is that reasonable\n\napprehension. The right lasts so long as the reasonable apprehension of the\n\ndanger to the body continues. In Jai Dev. v. State of Punjab (AIR 1963 SC\n\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">612), it was observed that as soon as the cause for reasonable apprehension\n\ndisappears and the threat has either been destroyed or has been put to route,\n\nthere can be no occasion to exercise the right of private defence.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">11.   In order to find whether right of private defence is available or not,\n\nthe injuries received by the accused, the imminence of threat to his safety,\n\nthe injuries caused by the accused and whether the accused had time to have\n\nrecourse to public authorities are all relevant factors to be considered.\n\nSimilar view was expressed by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1583190/\" id=\"a_35\">Biran Singh v. State of Bihar</a>\n\n(AIR 1975 SC 87). (See: <a href=\"/doc/1957166/\" id=\"a_36\">Wassan Singh v. State of Punjab</a> (1996) 1 SCC\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                     8</span>\n\f458, Sekar alias <a href=\"/doc/1043321/\" id=\"a_37\">Raja Sekharan v.

The State of Punjab</a> (AIR 1991 SC 1316),\n\na person who is apprehending death or bodily injury cannot weigh in golden\n\nscales on the spur of the moment and in the heat of circumstances, the\n\nnumber of injuries required to disarm the assailants who were armed with\n\nweapons. In moments of excitement and disturbed mental equilibrium it is\n\noften difficult to expect the parties to preserve composure and use exactly\n\nonly so much force in retaliation which is commensurate with the danger\n\napprehended to him where assault is imminent by use of force. It would be\n\nlawful to repel the force in self-defence and the right of private-defence\n\ncommences, as soon as the threat becomes imminent. Such situations have\n\nto be pragmatically viewed and not with high-powered spectacles or\n\nmicroscopes to detect slight or even marginal overstepping. Due weightage\n\nhas to be given to, and hyper technical approach has to be avoided in\n\nconsidering what happens on the spur of the moment on the spot and\n\nkeeping in view normal human reaction and conduct, where self-\n\npreservation is the paramount consideration. But, if the fact situation shows\n\nthat in the guise of self-preservation, what really has been done is to assault\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                     9</span>\n\fthe original aggressor, even after the cause of reasonable apprehension has\n\ndisappeared, the plea of right of private-defence can legitimately be\n\nnegatived. The Court dealing with the plea has to weigh the material to\n\nconclude whether the plea is acceptable. It is essentially, as noted above, a\n\nfinding of fact.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_25\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_26\">13.   The right of self-defence is a very valuable right, serving a social\n\npurpose and should not be construed narrowly. (<a href=\"/doc/1636646/\" id=\"a_39\">See Vidhya Singh v. State\n\nof M.P</a>. (AIR 1971 SC 1857).        Situations have to be judged from the\n\nsubjective point of view of the accused concerned in the surrounding\n\nexcitement and confusion of the moment, confronted with a situation of\n\nperil and not by any microscopic and pedantic scrutiny. In adjudging the\n\nquestion as to whether more force than was necessary was used in the\n\nprevailing circumstances on the spot it would be inappropriate, as held by\n\nthis Court, to adopt tests by detached objectivity which would be so natural\n\nin a Court room, or that which would seem absolutely necessary to a\n\nperfectly cool bystander. The person facing a reasonable apprehension of\n\nthreat to himself cannot be expected to modulate his defence step by step\n\nwith any arithmetical exactitude of only that much which is required in the\n\nthinking of a man in ordinary times or under normal circumstances.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                    10</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_27\">\f14.   In the illuminating words of Russel (Russel on Crime, 11th Edition\n\nVolume I at page 49):\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_28\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">             \"....a man is justified in resisting by force anyone who\n             manifestly intends and endeavours by violence or\n             surprise to commit a known felony against either his\n             person, habitation or property. In these cases, he is not\n             obliged to retreat, and may not merely resist the attack\n             where he stands but may indeed pursue his adversary\n             until the danger is ended and if in a conflict between\n             them he happens to kill his attacker, such killing is\n             justifiable.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p_29\">15.   The right of private defence is essentially a defensive right\n\ncircumscribed by the governing statute i.e. the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_40\">IPC</a>, available only when the\n\ncircumstances clearly justify it. It should not be allowed to be pleaded or\n\navailed as a pretext for a vindictive, aggressive or retributive purpose of\n\noffence. It is a right of defence, not of retribution, expected to repel\n\nunlawful aggression and not as retaliatory measure. While providing for\n\nexercise of the right, care has been taken in <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_41\">IPC</a> not to provide a mechanism\n\nwhereby an attack may be a pretence for killing. A right to defend does not\n\ninclude a right to launch an offensive, particularly when the need to defend\n\nno longer survived.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_30\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                    11</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_31\">\f16.

In the present case the High Court has rightly held that even if it is\n\naccepted that at some point of time the appellant was exercising the right of\n\nprivate defence, the same was exceeded and has rightly found him guilty\n\nunder Section 304 Part I, <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_43\">IPC</a> and sentenced him to undergo imprisonment\n\nfor five years. The sentence as imposed cannot be considered to be harsh.\n\nOn payment of fine of Rs.20,000/-, same was to be paid to the heirs of the\n\ndeceased.

The basic fact of the matter is not in dispute.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">      An advertisement was issued on or about 18.01.2001 by the State of\n\nWest Bengal inviting applications from companies/firms/societies formed\n\nby unemployed youth for the purpose of grant of excise licence for country\n\nspirit shops in certain locations. Appellant No. 1, a partnership firm of the\n\nappellant Nos. 2 and 3 herein applied therefor.         In terms of the said\n\nadvertisement, respondent No. 1, which is also a partnership firm of which\n\nrespondent Nos. 2 and 3 are partners as also several others, applied for\n\nallotment of the said country spirit shop.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">4.    In the select list, the appellant No. 1 was placed at Sl. No. 3 whereas\n\nthe respondent No. 1 was placed at Sl. No. 1. The candidature of the\n\nrespondent No. 1 was objected to by the appellants inter alia contending that\n\nthe respondent Nos. 2 and 3 were not `unemployed youth' within the\n\nmeaning of the said advertisement and two locations of the liquor shops\n\nproposed by them were not conducive therefor.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">5.

Rajib Chattopadhyay\n             has admitted that he sells electrical goods of the\n             said shop. Rajib Chattopadhyay submitted a\n             Xerox copy of a challan showing deposit of\n             profession Tax by Sanjib Chattopadhyay, as a\n             token of Sanjib's shop. Rajib Chattopadhyay has\n             admitted that there are decorators' shop and\n             tailoring shop by the side of the proposed country\n             spirit shop and the proposed shop is within 30/40\n             feet from the Bishnupur, Kotulpur metalled Road.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">             Another partner, Sri Subhendu Chatterjee has\n             admitted that he was a businessman and dealt in\n             potato till March, 2001.       They signed the\n             application form for grant of license for country\n             spirit shop on 12.2.2001 and mentioned in column\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                    4</span>\n\n\n            4 seasonal business - paddy, Til potatoes etc.\n            against business or sales experience, if any,\n            Subhendu Chatterjee has further admitted that he\n            took loan of Rs. 25,000/- (Rupees Twenty five\n            thousand) for business from Chatramore co-\n            operative Bank but he could not repay the same till\n            4.1.2002.

From the above, it transpires that\n            Subhendu Chatterjee, as on the date of application,\n            was self-employed, at least, partially and the site\n            for the proposed country spirit shop is situated\n            within the market place of Chatramore.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_17\">6.

Aggrieved by and dissatisfied therewith, appellants filed a writ\n\napplication before the Calcutta High Court.

It was directed:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">             \"I accordingly allow this writ application and set\n             aside the order dated December 9, 2002 issued by\n             the District Magistrate and Collector, Bankura\n             granting licence in favour of the Private\n             respondents as well as the order passed by the\n             Appellate Authority dated July 25, 2003 which\n             affirmed the said order.

It cannot be assumed from the nature of the\nadvertisement that by 'unemployed youth' the\nauthorities have meant a person who shall be\ntotally without any income in order to sustain\nhimself. There is no basis for such assumption. In\nfact, in order to get; the licence the candidates will\nhave to furnish an objection free site, normally\nsuch a site has to be obtained either by taking it on\nrent or by offering such a site which is part of\none's property. Apart from that such unemployed\nyouths are supposed to show some financial\nstrength by way of furnishing of bank balance and\nso on. It is not expected that a person who has no\nincome even to sustain himself will be able to\nsatisfy these requirements.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_23\">\n</p><p id=\"p_24\">12. In the instant case it may be noted that the\nappellants are earning some money in order to\nsustain themselves but it is nobody's case that they\nhave got any permanent employment or they are\nserving in any institution as regularly paid\nemployees. In fact the registration of persons'\nname in Employment Exchange will show that the\npersons concerned have registered themselves as\nunemployed youth for an employment but have\nnot got the employment. The same is true of the\nappellants also. It is not disputed by anybody that\nthey are registered with the Employment\nExchange. But even after such registration they are\nnot getting any employment in order to sustain\nthemselves. But they are doing some work may be\nby way of seasonal business or by working in\nfamily business which cannot be called an\nemployment. Therefore on this ground alone the\nlicence which has been granted to the appellants\ncannot be rejected. In this connection this Court is\nalso constrained to observe that since the\nexpression 'unemployed youth' has been explained\nin the advertisement with the help of expression\n'mean', there is no scope for further interpreting\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                     7</span>\n\n\n            the said expression 'unemployed youth' with the\n            help of Black's Law Dictionary or an ordinary\n            dictionary.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_25\">\n\n\n      It was held:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_26\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">            \"17. In view of such authoritative pronouncement\n            of law on the subject it is difficult for this Court to\n            accept the interpretation of 'unemployed youth'\n            given by the learned Judge by relying on Black's\n            Law Dictionary. The learned Judge possibly fell\n            into an error by not holding that, here the\n            expression 'unemployed youth' must receive a\n            contextual interpretation namely it would mean a\n            person who has not been substantially employed\n            or has not been in any service even though lie is\n            registered as an unemployed youth with the\n            Employment Exchange and as has been so\n            declared by the authorities and also must be within\n            a certain age group. Apart from that there is no\n            other requirement.

The meaning of the term `unemployed youth' must be culled out from\n\nthe text and context in which the same appeared.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_37\">17.   In Black's Law Dictionary, 5th edition, `Unemployment' is defined as\n\n`state of being not employed; lack of employment'. The word `unemployed'\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                       12</span>\n\n\nhas been explained in the New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 1993 as\n\n`not made use of, use for a particular purpose, not engaged in any\n\noccupation, idle, out of paid employment, redundant'.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_38\">18.       The main thrust in this case, however, appears to be on the\n\nregistration of a person as unemployed in the employment exchange.\n\nCertificate is required to be given by the authorities specified therein as\n\ndespite such registration and/ or continuation thereof, a person may be\n\nemployed with a private person or in some other districts or in some other\n\nstates.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_39\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_40\">19.       In a case of this nature, a person cannot be said to be employed only\n\nbecause he earns his bare subsistence livelihood by engaging himself in\n\nsome work. In this case, one of the respondents was helping his brother\n\nwho was owner of the shop. He was not the owner of the shop. The other\n\nrespondent used to carry on business which is of seasonal nature. He was,\n\ntherefore, also not a full fledged businessman. Nothing has been brought on\n\nrecord to show that they were income tax payees or were otherwise\n\nestablished in their life. It may be true that the authorities specified in the\n\nExplanation appended to Clause 3 of the said Order were required to issue\n\ncertificate on the basis of their own concept in regard thereto. It is true that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                     13</span>\n\n\nno guideline had been issued, but, probably no guideline was required to be\n\nissued, as the said authorities concerned, keeping in view the legal position,\n\nwould be presumed to be aware of the financial status as also the fact as to\n\nwhether they remained unemployed. Furthermore, the said Order does not\n\ncontemplate that the applicants would be absolutely poor or they would not\n\nhave any property at all. They were required to establish a business in\n\nliquor. They were required to make substantial investment. Their financial\n\ncapacity was required to be such so as to enable them to carry out the\n\nbusiness and furthermore fulfill their obligations both contractual and\n\nstatutory in terms of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/110162683/\" id=\"a_1\">Excise Act</a>, the Rules framed\n\nthereunder as also the conditions of licence.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_41\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_42\">20.   In the instant case, the Division Bench satisfied itself that the\n\nrespondents were to be considered as `unemployed youth' in terms of the\n\naforementioned advertisement.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_43\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_44\">21.   In a situation of this nature, the interpretation clause should be given\n\na contextual meaning. It is not exhaustive. It is trite that when a statutory\n\nenactment defines its terms, the same should govern what is proved,\n\nauthorized or done under or by reference to that enactment. It is also trite\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                     14</span>\n\n\nthat all statutory definitions have to be read subject to the qualification\n\nvariously expressed in the interpretation clause, which created them.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_45\">      <a href=\"/doc/1924149/\" id=\"a_2\">In Feroze N.

On the other hand, when the word\n            \"includes\" is used in the definition, the legislature\n            does not intend to restrict the definition: it makes\n            the definition enumerative but not exhaustive.\n            That is to say, the term defined will retain its\n            ordinary meaning but its scope would be extended\n            to bring within it matters, which in its ordinary\n            meaning may or may not comprise. Therefore, the\n            use of the word \"means\" followed by the word\n            \"includes\" in <a href=\"/doc/1481351/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 2(bb)</a> of the ID Act is clearly\n            indicative of the legislative intent to make the\n            definition exhaustive and would cover only those\n            banking companies which fall within the purview\n            of the definition and no other.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_59\">22.

The Work Order was issued on 6th\n\nJune, 2006, and as per the appellant's version the\n\nwork    was   completed          by    the     end     of    October,         2006.\n\nAccording to the appellant, after giving credit for\n\npayments which had been made by the Corporation, a\n\nsum of Rs.68,46,872/- was still due towards the work\n\nperformed     in    the     Dariapur           ward,    while       a    sum     of\n\nRs.8,61,760/- was also due for the work carried out\n\nin Kalupur ward.            It is the case of the appellant\n\nthat    despite         notice        having     been       served       on    the\n\nCorporation        on    24th    May,        2007,     the    said       amounts\n\nremained unpaid. Ultimately, on 6th June, 2007, the\n\nappellant issued a notice to the Corporation setting\n\nout the facts relating to the work performed and the\n\nclaim    made       in     detail        and      claimed       a        sum     of\n\nRs.77,08,632/-, together with interest at the rate of\n\n18% per annum, from the due date till the date of\n\nrealization,       which        the    appellant        claimed,         was    the\n\ntotal outstanding amount.                 In the notice it was also\n\nindicated that the claim made by the appellant should\n\nbe   accepted      and     payment       should        be    made       within       a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                                          3</span>\n\n\nperiod of 30 days from the date of receipt of the\n\nnotice or that an Arbitrator should be appointed by\n\nthe Corporation within a period of 30 days from the\n\ndate of receipt of the notice.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">3.   As there was no response to the said notice from\n\nthe Municipal Corporation nor was any payment made or\n\nArbitrator appointed, the appellant invoked clause 30\n\nof Form B-I, which provided for the appointment of an\n\nArbitrator and was made applicable in the contract\n\nentered into between the parties when the appellant's\n\ntender was accepted.       It appears that under General\n\nConditions of Contract of the Engineering Department\n\nof   the   Ahmedabad   Municipal   Corporation,   under   its\n\nGeneral Specifications it is provided that certain\n\nconditions are required to be followed which includes\n\nthe condition that Form B-I would be applicable to\n\nthe contract and clause 30 of Form B-I is relevant\n\nfor this case. The relevant portions of clause 30 of\n\nForm B-I reads as follows :-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     \"Clause 30(1)   Disputes to be referred to\n     Tribunal:   The disputes relating to this\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                                                    4</span>\n\n\n       contract, so far as they relate to any of\n       the following matters, whether such disputes\n       arise during the progress of the work or\n       after the completion or abandonment thereof,\n       shall   be   referred  to   the  Arbitration\n       Tribunal, Gujarat State;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">       (2) ...............\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">       (3) The provision of <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_1\">Arbitration Act</a>, shall\n       in so far as they are inconsistent with the\n       provision of this Act, cease to apply to any\n       dispute arising from a works contract and\n       all arbitration proceedings in relation to\n       such dispute before an Arbitrator, Court or\n       authority shall stand transferred to the\n       Tribunal.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_9\">4.     The appellant filed a petition before the Gujarat\n\nHigh      Court          on   9th   July,   2007,   being   Arbitration\n\nPetition No. 35 of 2007, under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 11</a> of the\n\nArbitration and <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_3\">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996, hereinafter\n\nreferred to as \"the 1996 Act\", inter alia, praying\n\nfor the appointment of an Arbitrator to resolve the\n\ndisputes between the parties. The High Court by its\n\norder dated 20th November, 2007, rejected the said\n\npetition. While doing so, the High Court took note of\n\nSection 2(1)(k) of the Gujarat Public Works Contracts\n\nDisputes Arbitration Tribunal Act, 1992, hereinafter\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                                                         5</span>\n\n\nreferred    to     as    the    \"Gujarat      Tribunal        Act\",    which\n\ndefines \"works contract\" to mean a contract made by\n\nthe State Government or Public Undertaking which is\n\nnotified     in     the    Official      Gazette         by    the     State\n\nGovernment.        The High Court also noticed <a href=\"/doc/738672/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 2(1)</a>\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">(l)   of    the    aforesaid      Act,     which      defines        \"Public\n\nUndertaking\" to, inter alia, mean such class of local\n\nauthorities       as    the    State    Government        specifies       by\n\nNotification in the Official Gazette. It was further\n\nnoticed that in the absence of such Notification, the\n\nAhmedabad    Municipal         Corporation      was      not    a    \"Public\n\nUndertaking\" and the contract entered into by it with\n\nthe appellant could not, therefore, be termed as a\n\n\"Works Contract\" as defined in <a href=\"/doc/738672/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 2(1)(k)</a> of the\n\naforesaid Act.          The High Court, therefore, held that\n\nthe Arbitration Tribunal, Gujarat State, would have\n\nno jurisdiction to entertain the disputes between the\n\nparties emanating from the Work Order in question.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">5.    The   High    Court      then    went    on   to    consider       the\n\napplicability       of    the    Arbitration        and       <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_6\">Conciliation\n\nAct</a>, 1996, to the facts of the case.                     The High Court\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                                                     6</span>\n\n\ntook note of the fact that the Agreement between the\n\nparties,     and    more       particularly        the     Arbitration\n\nAgreement,    did       not    lay        down   any   procedure    for\n\nappointing         an         Arbitrator          or       Arbitrators.\n\nAccordingly, in the absence of such procedure, the\n\nDesignated Court could not invoke its jurisdiction\n\nunder Sub-section (6) of <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 11</a> of the 1996 Act,\n\nwhich contemplates a situation, where the appointment\n\nprocedure    as    agreed      to    by    the   parties    under   Sub-\n\nsection (2) of <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 11</a> is not followed. The High\n\nCourt, therefore, while rejecting the applicability\n\nof the Gujarat Tribunal Act, also closed the doors\n\nfor relief under the provisions of the 1996 Act.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">6.   The said order of the High Court, which has been\n\nchallenged in this appeal, therefore, gives rise to\n\nthe question as to whether in the absence of any\n\nprocedure     in        the    Arbitration        clause      for    the\n\nappointment of an Arbitrator, can the Chief Justice\n\nof the High Court or the Designated Court appoint an\n\nArbitrator under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 11(6)</a> of the 1996 Act in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                                                      7</span>\n\n\nterms of the Agreement between the parties to have\n\ntheir disputes settled by arbitration.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">7.    Mr.    S.K.     Gambhir,       learned        Senior     Advocate\n\nappearing for the appellant company, submitted that\n\nhaving regard to the specific condition contained in\n\nthe   General    Conditions         of    Contract     regarding      the\n\napplication      of     Form       B-I,    the      parties     to    the\n\nArbitration Agreement could not be forced to file a\n\nsuit simply because the procedure for arbitration, as\n\nrequired under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 11(6)</a> of the 1996 Act, had not\n\nbeen agreed upon by the parties or specified therein.\n\nMr.   Gambhir    urged      that    when    there    was   a   specific\n\nArbitration Agreement between the parties, the remedy\n\nin respect thereof under the 1996 Act could not be\n\ndenied on a mere technicality and if no procedure had\n\nbeen mentioned in the Arbitration Agreement, it could\n\nnot   be    contended       that    on    such   ground       alone   the\n\nprovisions of Sub-section (6) of <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 11</a> could not\n\nbe invoked in view of the provisions of Sub-section\n\n(2)   thereof.        Mr.   Gambhir       submitted    that,     in   any\n\nevent, Sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 11</a> would have to be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                                              8</span>\n\n\nread with Sub-clauses (3) to (5) as well and the\n\npowers of the Chief Justice or the Designated Court\n\ncould not be fettered by Sub-section (6).                It was\n\nsubmitted that the Chief Justice or the Designated\n\nCourt     could   in   given     circumstances      appoint   an\n\nArbitrator by applying the provisions of Sub-section\n\n(6) of <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 11</a> of the said Act. It was submitted\n\nthat while the High Court had correctly held that the\n\nprovisions of the Gujarat Tribunal Act would have no\n\napplication in the present case, it had gone wrong in\n\nholding    that   no   relief    could   be   provided   to   the\n\nappellant under the provisions of the 1996 Act also.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">8.    Mr. Gambhir also contended that the requirements\n\nof Sub-section (6) of <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 11</a> of the 1996 Act have\n\nall     been   fulfilled,       although,     the   appointment\n\nprocedure had not been indicated by the parties.              He\n\nsubmitted that what was most important is that the\n\nparties had failed to reach an agreement regarding\n\nthe appointment of an Arbitrator to resolve their\n\ndisputes, which was the basic requirement to request\n\nthe Chief Justice or the Designated Court to secure\n\nthe appointment of an Arbitrator.             Mr. Gambhir drew\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                                                              9</span>\n\n\nour attention to the opinion provided by the Legal\n\nDepartment          of   the    Ahmedabad          Municipal       Corporation\n\nitself       indicating        that      in   the    event    of     a   dispute\n\nbetween a contractor and the Corporation in the work\n\nof the Engineering Department, proceedings will have\n\nto     be      initiated            under      the         Arbitration        and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_15\">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996.                     Mr. Gambhir also drew our\n\nattention        to      an     earlier        order        passed       by   the\n\nDesignated          Court      of     the     Gujarat       High     Court     in\n\nArbitration Petition Nos.46-55 of 2003 in respect of\n\na similar contract, where a retired Judge of the said\n\nHigh     Court       was      appointed       as     Sole    Arbitrator        to\n\nresolve the disputes between the parties after the\n\nparties       had     arrived       at    a   consensus       regarding       the\n\npassing of such an order.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">9.     Mr.     Gambhir         submitted            that     the     Ahmedabad\n\nMunicipal Corporation had themselves agreed to the\n\nappointment of an Arbitrator under the 1996 Act and\n\ncould not, therefore, resile from such position in\n\nthe instant case.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                                          10</span><p id=\"p_17\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">10. The stand taken by Mr. Gambhir was opposed by Mr.\n\nShyam Divan, learned Senior Advocate, who supported\n\nthe view taken by the High Court and submitted that\n\nthe appellant's remedy lay in the filing of a suit.\n\nIn the alternative, it was also submitted that the\n\ndecision in the matter could be deferred and a notice\n\ncould be issued to the State of Gujarat to indicate\n\nas to whether it had any intention of publishing a\n\nNotification as contemplated in Section 2(k) of the\n\nGujarat Tribunal Act.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_19\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">11. Mr. Divan further submitted that in the absence\n\nof such Notification, clause 30 of Form B-I would\n\nremain   inoperative   and   consequently    the   provisions\n\nrelating to the settlement of disputes by arbitration\n\nwould also not be available to the parties.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">12. Mr. Divan urged that other than Clause 30 of Form\n\nB-I, there was no other provision for arbitration in\n\nthe contract between the parties and the question of\n\ninvoking   jurisdiction      under   the    1996   Act   was,\n\ntherefore, misconceived. Mr. Divan urged that as the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                                                  11</span>\n\n\nbasic requirement of Sub-section (6) of <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 11</a>\n\nregarding an agreed procedure had not been fulfilled,\n\nneither the Chief Justice nor the Designated Court\n\ncould assume jurisdiction thereunder for appointing\n\nan Arbitrator.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_22\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">13. We have carefully considered the submissions made\n\non behalf of the respective parties and it appears\n\nthat we are called upon to decide two questions in\n\norder to decide this appeal. The first and possibly\n\nbasic   question     is   whether     in     the   absence   of        a\n\nNotification in the Official Gazette, the Municipal\n\nCorporation   can    at   all   be    considered    as   a   Public\n\nAuthority for the purpose of Section 2(1)(k) of the\n\nGujarat Tribunal Act, 1992. The other question is\n\nwhether the absence of a procedure for appointment of\n\nan Arbitrator in the Arbitration Agreement itself,\n\nwould   constitute    a   bar   for    the   appointment     of   an\n\nArbitrator under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 11(6)</a> or any other provision\n\nof the 1996 Act, when not only the parties to these\n\nproceedings, but the High Court as well, had arrived\n\nat a conclusion that the provisions of the Gujarat\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                                                         12</span>\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1850110/\" id=\"a_18\">Tribunal Act</a>, 1992, would not be applicable in the\n\ninstant case.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_24\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_25\">14. In this regard, we are inclined to accept the\n\nsubmissions of Mr. Gambhir notwithstanding the fact\n\nthat the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation had not been\n\nnotified to be a \"Public Undertaking\" as defined in\n\nSection 2(1)(iii) of the Gujarat Tribunal Act, 1992.\n\nThere    is   no      dispute      that     the     Ahmedabad    Municipal\n\nCorporation is a local authority and it could assume\n\nthe garb of a \"Public Undertaking\" only pursuant to a\n\nNotification published in that regard in the Official\n\nGazette.      On the other hand, even if Form B-I loses\n\nits   relevance         as   far     as    the    present     contract    is\n\nconcerned,         since       the        parties      have     agreed    to\n\nresolution       of     their      disputes       by   arbitration,      the\n\nprovisions of Sub-section (5) of the 1996 Act can be\n\npressed into service to enable the parties to invoke\n\nthe     powers     of    the    Chief        Justice     to   appoint     an\n\nArbitrator.        The stand taken by Mr. Divan is highly\n\ntechnical and is not in aid of resolution of the\n\ndisputes between the parties by an Arbitral Tribunal.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                                                           13</span>\n\n\nWhile    recognizing         the    right      of    the     appellant     to\n\napproach the Chief Justice or the Designated Court\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 11(6)</a> of the 1996 Act, the stand of the\n\nrespondent Corporation has been that the party should\n\nbe relegated to suit, which is quite contrary to the\n\nstand taken by it in the case of other employees.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_26\">15. <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 11</a> of the 1996 Act deals exclusively with\n\nthe   appointment       of     Arbitrators.

Sub-sections (3), (4) and (5) contemplate\n\ndifferent situations in which the Chief Justice or\n\nhis     Designate      could       be   requested       to     appoint     an\n\nArbitrator.      In our view, in the facts of this case,\n\nthe answer to the question thrown up in this appeal\n\nlies in Sub-clause (5) of <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 11</a> of the 1996 Act,\n\nwhich reads as follows :-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                                                   14</span><p id=\"p_27\">\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">       \"(5) Failing any agreement referred to in\n       sub-section (2), in an arbitration with a\n       sole arbitrator, if the parties fail to\n       agree on the arbitrator within thirty days\n       from receipt of a request by one party from\n       the other party to so agree the appointment\n       shall be made, upon request of a party, by\n       the   Chief   Justice   or  any  person  or\n       institution designated by him.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_28\">16. Having arrived at the aforesaid conclusion, the\n\nonly question that remains to be decided is whether\n\nthis matter should be remitted to the High Court for\n\nappointment of an Arbitrator or whether we should\n\nourselves    appoint     an    Arbitrator     in   terms      of   the\n\nArbitration Agreement.          Remitting the matter to the\n\nHigh     Court   would    only        mean   another     round      of\n\nlitigation, whereas if the appointment is made by us,\n\nthe     matter   will    achieve       finality,      which     would\n\nultimately be beneficial for all concerned.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_29\">17.

Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a learned Single\n\nJudge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court dismissing Second appeal\n\nfiled by the appellant in terms of Section 100 of the Code of Civil\n\nProcedure, 1908 (in short the `CPC'). The basic question considered by the\n\nHigh Court was whether sale of a specific portion of a land described by\n\fparticular Khasra numbers by a co-owner out of the joint khewat would be a\n\nsale of shares out of the joint land or whether the vendees become co-\n\nowners with other co-sharers in the joint land, in the event of their\n\nbecoming co-owners, the sale is pre-emptible under Section 15(1)(b) of\n\nPunjab Pre-emption Act, 1913 (in short the `Act').\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">3.    Background facts essentially are as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">      Vendor (Bhartu) sold the land measuring 20 kanals, being 400/3723\n\nshare out of the total land measuring 186 kanals 3 marlas vide registered\n\nsale deed dated 11.4.1990 to the appellants for a consideration of\n\nRs.1,80,000/-. Gurmej Singh-respondent filed a suit for possession by way\n\nof pre-emption, wherein it was pleaded that the vendor had sold the land\n\nmeasuring 20 kanals out of the joint Khewat. According to him being the\n\nco-sharer he has a right to pre-empt the sale under Section 15(1)(b) of the\n\nAct. The said suit was contested by the vendees stating that the pre-emptor\n\nhad no superior right of pre-emption. Firstly, the Khewat containing the suit\n\nland had been partitioned between various co-sharers much prior to the sale\n\nthrough an oral partition, and secondly the sale was out of the defined share\n\nof the vendor. On the basis of the pleading of the parties various issues were\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                     2</span>\n\fframed. But only two issues were contested before the trial Court which are\n\nto the following effect:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">          (1)   Whether plaintiff has superior right to pre-empt the land in\n\ndispute being co-sharer?\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">          (2)   Whether plaintiff is estopped from filing present suit by his\n\nown act and conduct?\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">          On both the issues the trial Court returned its findings in favour of the\n\npre-emptor holding that he had a superior right of pre-emption and that he\n\nwas not guilty of any such act which could stop him for pre-empting the\n\nsame. Appeal before learned District Judge, Kurukshetra, did not bring any\n\nrelief.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">          Stand of the appellants before the High Court was that the sale deed\n\nExt.P-4 clearly indicated that specific Khasra numbers had been sold by the\n\nvendor and defined portion of the joint land has been sold and the vendees\n\nhave been put into possession of the specific khasra numbers. The\n\nappellants who are vendees argued that where a co-sharer sells his share as a\n\nspecified part of joint land the vendees do not become co-sharers the sale\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                         3</span>\n\fbeing not a share out of the joint land. It was, therefore, submitted that the\n\nplaintiff respondent does not become a co-sharer in the property in dispute\n\nand as such has no preferential right of pre-emption with regard to sale of\n\nspecific part of the vendor's share. Reliance was placed on a decision of\n\nFull Bench of the High Court in <a href=\"/doc/1819124/\" id=\"a_1\">Lachhman Singh v. Pritam Chand</a> (AIR\n\n1970 P &amp; H 304).\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">      On the other hand respondent relied on a later Full Bench judgment\n\nof the High Court in Bhartu v. Ram Sarup (1981 P.L.J. 204) to support the\n\nview of the lower courts.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_18\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">      The High Court noted        that the latter decision had taken into\n\nconsideration Lachhman Singh's case (supra) and observed that the question\n\ninvolved in Lachhman Singh's case was as to whether the purchaser of a\n\nspecific portion of some Killa numbers in two rectangles would become a\n\nco-sharer in the Khewat consisting of several other rectangles and would be\n\nentitled to pre-empt the sale out of the rectangles other than in which he\n\nbecame owner by the said purchase and on these facts it was held that such\n\na purchaser does not become a co-sharer in the Khewat and, therefore, has\n\nno right to pre-empt the sale.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_20\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                     4</span>\n\f      The High Court observed that the principles laid down in Lachhman\n\nSingh's case (supra) had no direct bearing on the question whether the sale\n\nof a specific khasra number out of a khewat would be a sale of a share out\n\nof the joint land or not. According to the High Court, answer to the above\n\nquestion depends on inter-se rights of the co-sharers in the joint khewat and\n\nthe nature of the sale of a specified portion of the joint holding.\n\nAccordingly, the High Court held that when a co-sharer sells his share in the\n\njoint holding or in part thereof and put the vendees into possession of the\n\nland in his possession what he transfers is his right as co-sharer in the said\n\nland and the right would remain in his exclusive possession till the joint\n\nholding is partitioned amongst all the co-sharers. The transferee gets the\n\nsame right as that of a transferor to joint possession and has further right to\n\nenforce the partition of the same irrespective of the fact whether the\n\nproperty sold is fractional share or specified portion exclusively in\n\npossession of the transferor. After referring to the sale deed the High Court\n\nnoticed that the vendor had sold the land of his share of 400/3723\n\nmeasuring 20 kanals out of the total land. It was mentioned in the sale deed\n\nthat the possession of the land comprised in the specified khasra numbers\n\nwas delivered to the vendees. However, it was nowhere mentioned in the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                     5</span>\n\fsale deed that the land was ever partitioned or was out of the defined part of\n\nthe land. On the contrary, it was clearly mentioned that the vendor was\n\nselling his 400/3723 share out of the total holding. The High Court turned\n\ndown the plea based on repeal of the right of a co-sharer by the <a href=\"/doc/1596533/\" id=\"a_2\">Amending\n\nAct</a> of 1995. It was observed that right of co-sharers has been held to be\n\nprospective in operation and does not affect the right of the parties to the\n\nlitigation on the date of adjudication of the pre-emption suit and the\n\nAppellate Court is not required to take into account or give effect to the\n\nsubstituted <a href=\"/doc/1596533/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 15</a> introduced by the <a href=\"/doc/1596533/\" id=\"a_4\">Amending Act</a>. Accordingly,\n\nSecond Appeal was dismissed.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_21\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">4.      Learned counsel for the appellants re-iterated the stand taken before\n\nthe High court and submitted that the ratio of the decision of the Full Bench\n\nin Lachhman Singh's case (supra) has full application to the facts of the\n\ncase.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_23\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_24\">5.      In response, learned counsel for the respondent supported the\n\njudgment of the High Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_25\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                     6</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_26\">\f6.    It is to be noted that the subsequent Full Bench judgment in Bhartu's\n\ncase (supra) the earlier decision in Lachhman Singh's case (supra) was\n\ndistinguished on facts.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_27\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_28\">7.    The principles relating to the inter-se rights and liabilities of co-\n\nsharers are as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_29\">\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">       (l) A co-owner has an interest in the whole property and also in every\n\n      parcel of it.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      (2) Possession of joint property by one co-owner is in the eye of law,\n\n      possession of all even if all but one are actually out of possession.\n\n      (3) A mere occupation of a larger portion or even of an entire joint\n\n      property does not necessarily amount to ouster as the possession of\n\n      one is deemed to be on behalf of all.</blockquote><p id=\"p_30\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_31\">      (4) The above rule admits of an exception when there is ouster of a\n\n      co-owner by another. But in order to negative the presumption of\n\n      joint possession on behalf of all, on the ground of ouster, the\n\n      possession of a co-owner must not only be exclusive but also hostile\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                     7</span>\n\f      to the knowledge of the other as, when a co-owner openly asserts his\n\n      own title and denies, that of the other.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_32\">      (5) Passage of time does not extinguish the right of the co-owner who\n\n      has been out of possession of the joint property except in the event of\n\n      ouster or abandonment.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_33\">      (6) Every co-owner has a right to use the joint property in a husband\n\n      like manner not inconsistent with similar rights of other co-owners.\n\n      (7) Where a co-owner is in possession of separate parcels under an\n\n      arrangement consented by the other co-owners, it is not open to any\n\n      body to disturb the arrangement without the consent of others except\n\n      by filing a suit for partition.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_34\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_35\">8.    It is thus evident that when a co-sharer is in exclusive possession of\n\nsome portion of the joint holding he is in possession thereof as a co-sharer\n\nand is entitled to continue in its possession if it is not more than his share\n\ntill the joint holding is partitioned. Vendor cannot sell any property with\n\nbetter rights than himself.

Leave granted in both the Special Leave Petitions.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_4\">2.    The controversy in the two appeals lies within a very narrow\n\ncompass.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">Writ Petition No.3445 of 2004 was filed by the respondent before the Orissa\n\nHigh Court, inter-alia, with a prayer that his license as a Super Class\n\nContractor should not be cancelled by the respondent No.2 i.e. Chairman of\n\fthe Committee of Chief Engineers and Engineers in Chief, Orissa. The Writ\n\nPetition was filed under the apprehension that his license was likely to be\n\ncancelled. The High Court disposed of the Writ Petition by order dated\n\n13.5.2004 after hearing learned counsel for the writ petitioner and learned\n\nGovernment Advocate with a direction that without issuing show cause\n\nnotice to the writ petitioner and without giving him a fair opportunity of\n\nhearing, his license as Super Class Contractor shall not be cancelled and his\n\nsecurity deposit shall not be forfeited.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">3.    Several miscellaneous cases were thereafter filed by the respondents.\n\nBy order dated 7.10.2005 the Chairman of the aforesaid Committee directed\n\ncancellation of respondent's license under Rule 11(a) of P.W.D. Contractors\n\nRegistration Rules, 1967 (in short the `Rules'). This was questioned by the\n\nrespondent by filing a writ petition taking the stand that the order was\n\npassed by the Chief Engineer, but no notice was issued prior to passing of\n\nthe order. The High Court by order dated 9.2.2007 allowed the Writ\n\nPetition, quashing several orders passed on the ground that before the\n\ncancellation was done, no notice was given. Reference was made by the\n\npresent appellants to notice purportedly issued on 21.2.2004. It was stated\n\nthat before the order was passed by the High Court in Writ Petition\n\nNo.3445/2004, a show cause notice had already been issued. The\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                      2</span>\n\frespondent filed a rejoinder affidavit taking the stand that after the order\n\nwas passed on 13.5.2004 in the earlier writ petition, no notice was issued.\n\nThe High Court noticed that before cancellation of the license no notice had\n\nbeen issued and the previous writ petition was disposed of with a specific\n\ndirection that without notice and grant of fair opportunity of hearing license\n\nshall not be cancelled and the security shall not be forfeited. Undisputedly,\n\nafter the date of the High Court's order, no notice was issued. Thereafter,\n\nseveral miscellaneous cases were filed for extension of time. An application\n\nwas also filed for modification of order passed on 9.2.2007 by the High\n\nCourt. But the High Court by order dated 25.6.2008 rejected the same and\n\nfurther directed the present appellants to implement the order dated\n\n9.2.2007.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">4.    Learned counsel for the appellant-state and its functionaries\n\nsubmitted the earlier writ petition was disposed of without issuance of\n\nnotice and the High Court should have taken note of the fact that prior to the\n\ndate of order, notice had been issued.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">5.    Learned counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, submitted that\n\nthe High Court specifically directed that before cancellation and forfeiture\n\nnotice has to be given. Even though notice was not formerly issued in the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                     3</span>\n\fearlier petition, learned Government Advocate appeared for the State and its\n\nfunctionaries. He did not bring to the notice of the High Court that any show\n\ncause notice was issued on 21.2.2004. The matter was disposed of on\n\n13.5.2004 i.e. after about three months. It was pointed out that the\n\ncancellation order was passed on 7.10.2005. Before that also there was no\n\nprayer made to modify the earlier order. It was never the stand of the State\n\nand its functionaries about the issuance of notice on 21.2.2004. We find that\n\nthe stand taken by the respondent is factually correct. The order dated\n\n13.5.2004 was very specific to the effect that before cancellation and\n\nforfeiture of security deposit, notice has to be given. That admittedly has not\n\nbeen done. In the circumstances we dispose of both the appeals with a\n\ndirection that the impugned order of the High Court shall remain operative.\n\nIt is open to the appellant-State and its functionaries to issue notice in terms\n\nof the order passed by the High Court in Writ Petition No.3445/2004 and\n\nafter grant of opportunity, decide the matter in accordance with law. The\n\nappeals are accordingly disposed of.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">                                           ...........................................J.\n                                           (Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT)\n\n\n                                           ..........................................J.\n                                           (ASOK KUMAR GANGULY)\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                       4</span>\n\fNew Delhi,\nJanuary 27, 2009\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                   5</span>\n\f</p>"}, {"numcites":3,"covertitles":[],"relatedqs":[{"value":"babu singh","formInput":"babu%20singh"},{"value":"sohan singh","formInput":"sohan%20singh"},{"value":"mutation","formInput":"mutation"},{"value":"ferozepur","formInput":"ferozepur"},{"value":"pasayat","formInput":"pasayat"},{"value":"arijit pasayat","formInput":"arijit%20pasayat"},{"value":"shadow witness","formInput":"shadow%20witness"},{"value":"illegal gratification","formInput":"illegal%20gratification"},{"value":"pf","formInput":"pf"},{"value":"gratification ","formInput":"gratification%20"},{"value":"what is ddr","formInput":"what%20is%20ddr"}],"citeList":[{"tid":312089,"url":"http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgst.aspx?filename=28200","title":"State Of Madhya Pradesh vs Shambhu Dayal Nagar on 2 November, 2006"},{"tid":398491,"url":"http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgst.aspx?filename=14294","title":"Swatantar Singh vs State Of Haryana & Ors on 3 March, 1997"},{"tid":1259316,"url":null,"title":"Section 13(2) in The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988"}],"covers":[],"title":"Surain Singh vs State Of Punjab on 27 January, 2009","publishdate":"2009-01-27","divtype":"judgments","citedbyList":[{"tid":1732687,"url":"http://ldemo.mp.nic.in/causelist/ciskiosk/asafr/RKS240811CRA--0343599.pdf","title":"Ml.Chourasia vs The State Of M.P on 24 August, 2011"},{"tid":1286669,"url":"http://ldemo.mp.nic.in/causelist/ciskiosk/asafr/RKS300811CRA--0150800.pdf","title":"Babulal vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 30 August, 2011"},{"tid":170513287,"url":"http://lobis.nic.in/dhc/MUG/judgement/22-05-2013/MUG20052013CRLA2612003.pdf","title":"K.Lal vs C.B.I. on 20 May, 2013"},{"tid":1615588,"url":"http://judis.nic.in/judis_chennai/qrydisp.aspx?filename=20117","title":"A.

Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a learned Single Judge\n\nof Punjab and Haryana High Court            upholding the conviction of the\n\nappellant for offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1259316/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 13(2)</a> of the Prevention of\n\nCorruption Act, 1988 (in short the `Act'). According to the prosecution\n\nversion the appellant while working as a Patwari of Circle Gudher Dhandi\n\fhad demanded illegal gratification of Rs.300/- for entering the mutation on\n\nthe basis of a sale deed. Learned Special Judge, Ferozepur, by judgment\n\ndated 28.5.1996 had found him guilty and sentenced him to undergo\n\nrigorous imprisonment for two years and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/- with\n\ndefault stipulation.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">3.    Prosecution version in a nutshell is as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">      On 17.12.1990, Kehar Singh complainant approached the accused in\n\nhis office situated near Baghi Hospital, Ferozepur, for entering the mutation\n\nin the names of his sons namely Wasakha Singh and Darshan Singh, on the\n\nbasis of the sale deed relating to 4 kanals land purchased by them from one\n\nAhama Ram son of Mohna Ram resident of Village Gudhar Dhandi for a\n\nconsideration of Rs.10,000/-. The accused demanded a sum of Rs.400/- as\n\nillegal gratification for entering the mutation from the complainant, but the\n\nbargain was settled at Rs.300/-. As the complainant was not willing to pay\n\nthe money, he approached Sohan Singh (a shadow witness) and both of\n\nthem approached the Vigilance Bureau, Ferozepur, where Babu Singh,\n\nInspector Vigilance Department recorded his statement Ex.PF and took into\n\npossession three currency notes of the denomination of Rs.100/- each and\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                    2</span>\n\fafter applying pehnophsthalene powder and after conducting the personal\n\nsearch of the complainant, handed over to him the said currency notes.\n\nThereafter, he completed the formalities. Sohan Singh was deployed as\n\nshadow witness and he was directed to indicate after the accused accepts the\n\nillegal gratification. Babu Singh Inspector Vigilance Department, made his\n\nendorsement Ex.PF/ 1 on his statement Ex.PF and sent the same to the\n\npolice station, on the basis of which FIR Ex.PR was registered at police\n\nStation City, Ferozepur. On their way to the office of the accused, Hari\n\nSingh, a Government employee was also joined as a witness. When the\n\ncomplainant reached the office of the accused, then the accused enquired\n\nfrom the complainant about the bribe money, which was demanded on the\n\nprevious day. The complainant responded in positive and handed over the\n\naforesaid three currency notes to the accused. After the accused put the\n\nsame into his pocket, Sohan Singh, the shadow witness gave signal after\n\ngoing out of the office and the police apprehended the accused red handed.\n\nInspector Babu Singh after giving his identity arranged a glass tumbler and\n\nput clean water in the same and mixed sodium carbonate and made its\n\nsolution. He got washed the hands of Han Singh in the said water but the\n\ncolour of the water did not change. Thereafter, when the accused washed his\n\nhands, then the colour of the water turned pinkish. Thereafter, Inspector\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                    3</span>\n\fBabu Singh transferred the said mixture into an empty nip and prepared its\n\nparcel, sealed it and took the same into possession vide memo Ex.PH.\n\nThereafter, Inspector Babu Singh searched the accused and recovered three\n\ncurrency notes Ex.P1 to Ex.P3 from the front pocket of the shirt worn by\n\nhim. After comparing the numbers of the currency notes with the numbers\n\nrecorded in the memo Ex.PG, possession vide memo Ex.PJ of the same was\n\ntaken. Personal search of the accused was conducted. Documents recovered\n\nfrom him were taken into possession vide memo Ex.PK. He completed the\n\nother formalities; after recording the statements of the witnesses; got the\n\nsanction for prosecution of the accused; collected report of the Chemical\n\nExaminer Ex.PT and challaned the accused. The prosecution established its\n\ncase by examining Jait Kumar, Naib Sadar Kanungo (PW1), Kehar Singh\n\ncomplainant (PW2), Sohan Singh (PW3), Inspector Babu Singh (PW4).\n\nAfter tendering into evidence report of the Chemical Examiner Ex. PT, the\n\nprosecution closed its evidence.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">      The accused took the plea that he had not accepted any money and\n\nhad not recorded any entry in the mutation register and that the complainant\n\nhad a grudge against him.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                    4</span>\n\f      The trial Court found the prosecution version to be cogent and\n\ncredible and as noted above convicted him. In appeal, the stand taken was\n\nrelating to alleged animosity. The High Court did not find any substance in\n\nthe plea. It was noted that DDR 137 dated 23.11.1989 Ex. DA recorded by\n\nthe accused had no relevance. The demarcation had taken place on\n\n23.11.1989 whereas occurrence took place one year after the incident. In\n\nany event, demarcation of the land is not the final verdict regarding\n\nsurrender of land. It was also noted that so far as DDR 158 dated 8.12.1990\n\nEx. DB is concerned, the accused never gave any complaint to his higher\n\nofficers regarding alleged threat given by the complainant. DDR has been\n\nrecorded by the accused himself. There was nothing to show that the entry\n\nwas made on 8.12.1990. During investigation there was reference to it. For\n\nthe first time it was brought to light at the time of recording of evidence.\n\nAccordingly, the High Court dismissed the appeal.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">4.    In support of the appeal, learned counsel for the appellant re-iterated\n\nthe alleged animosity between the parties. It was also submitted that the\n\noccurrence took place in the year 1990, and more than 19 years have passed,\n\ntherefore, the sentence needs to be appropriately reduced.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                    5</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">\f5.    Learned counsel for the respondent-State supported the judgment.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">6.    The High Court has analysed in great detail the evidence to show that\n\nthe alleged animosity has not been established. Two witnesses PWs 2 and 3\n\nin detail had referred to the factual scenario and nothing discrepant has been\n\nbrought on record to cast any doubt on the credibility of their evidence.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">7.    Day in and day out the gigantic problem of corruption in the public\n\nservants is on the increase. Large scale corruption retards the nation-\n\nbuilding activities and everyone has to suffer on that count. Corruption is\n\ncorroding like cancerous lymph nodes, the vital veins of the body politics,\n\nsocial fabric of efficiency in the public service and demoralizing the honest\n\nofficers. The efficiency in public service would improve only when the\n\npublic servant devotes his sincere attention and does the duty diligently,\n\ntruthfully, honestly and devotes himself assiduously to the performance of\n\nthe duties of his post. (See: <a href=\"/doc/398491/\" id=\"a_2\">Swatantar Singh v. State of Haryana</a> (1997 (4)\n\nSCC 14) and <a href=\"/doc/312089/\" id=\"a_3\">State of M.P. v.

By the impugned\n\norders, the court has rejected the writ petition for non-prosecution and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                          1</span>\n\ffurther, has declined to grant the relief sought in the Restoration\n\nApplication only on the ground that the reasons stated in the affidavit\n\naccompanying the application are not satisfactory.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">4)    A Principal working in the \"Paramhans Sanskrit Pathshala\" is\n\nfighting against the mighty Management for payment of his salary and\n\nother allowances right from the year 1988. Since all his efforts to pursue\n\nthe Management to distribute the arrears of salary and the current salary\n\ndue to him, he was constrained to approach the court, inter alia, requesting\n\nthe court to issue a writ in the nature of mandamus, commanding the\n\nrespondents to release the entire arrears of salary to which he is entitled to\n\nand further, to continue to pay his salary and other allowances as and\n\nwhen the same became due to him.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">5)    Respondents have filed their counter affidavits.         Pleadings are\n\ncomplete. In the interregnum, several petitions/applications are filed\n\nbefore the High Court by both the parties. The appellant has succeeded in\n\nall those interlocutory matters.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                           2</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">\f6)    When the matter was posted before the Court on 05.08.2003,\n\nunfortunately for the appellant, his lawyers could not be present before the\n\ncourt, and, therefore, the court has rejected the writ petition for non-\n\nprosecution on the ground that though, one of the learned counsel Shri\n\nR.M. Saggi has sent his illness slip, the other counsel, whose name\n\nappears in the cause list, was not present before the court.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">7)    The appellant coming to know about the dismissal of the writ\n\npetition for non-prosecution, had filed Restoration Application, bringing\n\nto the notice of the court that he had engaged the services of Shri R.M.\n\nSaggi and Shri S.P. Srivastava, learned advocates, to prosecute the writ\n\npetition. Shri Saggi was unwell on the date when the writ petition was\n\nposted for hearing and, therefore, he had sent his illness slip and had\n\nrequested the court to accommodate him on account of illness and further,\n\nShri S.P. Srivastava, whose name also appeared in the cause list had been\n\nelevated to the bench of the High Court and, therefore, could not appear as\n\nthe counsel for the appellant.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                         3</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">\f8)    The explanation offered according to the learned Judges is not\n\nsatisfactory   and, therefore, have rejected the Restoration Application.\n\nAggrieved by these two orders, the appellant is before us in this appeal.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">9)    In our view, the approach of the learned Judges, to say the least is\n\nhyper technical. Admittedly, the appellant had engaged the services of\n\nShri S.P. Srivastava and Shri R.M. Saggi. Shri Srivastava is elevated to\n\nthe bench and, therefore, he could not appear as a counsel for the appellant\n\nthough his name was shown in the cause list. The other learned counsel\n\nwas suffering from physical ailment. Admittedly, he had sent \"illness\n\nslip\" with the request for adjournment. When these factual assertions\n\nwere not in dispute, in our opinion, court should have allowed the prayer\n\nmade in the Restoration Application and should have heard the case on\n\nmerits which was pending from last two decades.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">10)   It is true that the appellant has to take necessary steps to prosecute\n\nthe petition by following up action after filing the writ petition. The\n\nappellant had engaged the services of two learned counsels. Unfortunately\n\nfor him, one was elevated to the bench and other was suffering with\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                            4</span>\n\fphysical ailment. All this information was forthcoming in the application\n\nfiled for restoration.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">The High Court has not appreciated these facts. In our opinion, whether\n\nthe applicant has made out sufficient cause or not, in the application filed,\n\nthe court is required to look at all the facts pleaded in the application. No\n\ndoubt, the consideration of the existence of sufficient cause is the\n\ndiscretionary power with the court, but such discretion has to be exercised\n\non sound principles and not on mere technicalities. The approach of the\n\ncourt in such matters should be to advance the cause of justice and not the\n\ncause of technicalities. A case as far as possible should be decided on\n\nmerits and the party should not be deprived to get the case examined on\n\nthe merits.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_17\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">11)   In view of above, in our opinion, we cannot sustain the impugned\n\norders passed by the High Court, and therefore, the same requires to be\n\nset aside and the writ petition requires to be restored.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">12)   Accordingly, we set aside the impugned orders. We restore the writ\n\npetition on the file of the High Court. We request the High Court to\n\nconsider the writ petition on merits as expeditiously as possible at     any\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                          5</span>\n\frate within an outer limit of six months from the date of receipt of copy of\n\nthis order, after issuing notice to all the parties concerned.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">13)   The appeals are disposed of accordingly.

Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of the Division Bench of\n\nthe Chhattisgarh High Court upholding the conviction of the appellant for\n\nthe offences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_1\">Sections 302</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">324of</a> the Indian Penal\n\fCode, 1860 (in short the `<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_3\">IPC</a>'). The accused persons were sentenced to\n\nundergo imprisonment for life and for two years respectively for the said\n\noffences.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">3.    Prosecution version as unfolded during trial is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">      Mahgin Bai (PW-1) lodged the F.I.R (Ex. P-1) in the Police Station\n\nBhairamgarh on 4.2.1993 at about 12.30 p.m. to the effect that on 3.2.1993\n\nshe was thrashing paddy in the house. At that time her mother-in-law\n\nGangadei (hereinafter referred to as the `deceased') was preparing page.\n\nAccused Laxminath who is husband of her sister-in-law, came and\n\ndemanded page. Her mother-in-law gave page to the accused. He thereafter\n\ndemanded tobacco, on which her mother-in-law gave him tobacco also and\n\naccused left the house. Thereafter, the accused came with bow &amp; arrow and\n\nshot the arrow on her, which hit on her left upper arm and blood started\n\noozing out of it. Accused also shot an arrow on her mother-in-law, which hit\n\non chest, blood started oozing out of the injury and accused ran away. Her\n\nuncle-in-law Dhaniram (PW2) witnessed the incident, brought the villagers\n\nand by that time, her mother-in-law was alive. Arrow was stuck in the chest\n\nof her mother-in-law. Villagers took her mother-in-law to Police Station\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                    2</span>\n\fBhairamgarh from where they took her to Jagdalpur Hospital, but on the\n\nway near Mawlibhata Gangadei she succumbed to the injury. Receiving this\n\nreport, the police registered the FIR (Ex. P-1). The Investigating Officer left\n\nfor the scene of occurrence and took into possession the bow under Ex.P-2.\n\nThe Investigating Officer gave a written request Ex. P-3 to the Assistant\n\nSurgeon, Primary Health Centre, Bhairamgarh for examination of the\n\ninjuries of Mahgin Bai, on which doctor examined and prepared the injury\n\nreport and mentioned that there was one incised wound over left upper arm.\n\nArrow, weapon of offence was taken into possession under Ex.P-4 and the\n\npetticoat of deceased Gangadei was taken into possession under Ex.P-5.\n\nBlood stained soil and plain soil was taken into possession under Ex.P-6\n\nfrom the place of occurrence. Arrow in question was examined by the\n\ndoctor on the request of Station House Officer Ex.P-7 and doctor opined\n\nthat the injury on the body of Mahgin Bai could be caused by the said\n\narrow. Panchnama (Ex.P-10) of the body of Gangadei was prepared after\n\ngiving notice Ex.P-9 to the Panchas. Postmortem on the body of deceased\n\nGangadei was conducted by Dr. S.K. Naik and he prepared the post mortem\n\nreport. There was a dying declaration before PW-6.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                     3</span>\n\f      After completion of investigation, charge sheet was filed against the\n\naccused/appellant in the Court of learned Additional Chief Judicial\n\nMagistrate, Jagdalpur, who in turn committed the case to learned Sessions\n\nJudge, Jagdalpur from where learned 1st Additional Sessions Judge,\n\nJagdalpur received the case on transfer for trial. As accused pleaded\n\ninnocence, trial was held. Learned trial Judge recorded conviction as noted\n\nabove.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">      Before the High Court the basic stand was that the evidence was not\n\nsufficient to fasten guilt on the accused. The oral dying declaration was not\n\nbelievable.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">      It was also submitted that only one arrow was shot from a distance\n\nand, therefore, <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 302</a> IPC has no application. The High Court did not\n\naccept the plea and upheld the conviction and the sentence.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">4.    The stand before the High Court was reiterated before this Court.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                    4</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">\f5.    Learned counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, supported the\n\njudgment of the trial Court as affirmed by the High Court.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">6.    The basic question is whether <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 302</a> IPC has application.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">7.    In the scheme of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_6\">IPC</a> culpable homicide is genus and `murder' its\n\nspecie. All `murder' is `culpable homicide' but not vice-versa. Speaking\n\ngenerally, `culpable homicide' sans 'special characteristics of murder is\n\nculpable homicide not amounting to murder'. For the purpose of fixing\n\npunishment, proportionate to the gravity of the generic offence, the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_7\">IPC</a>\n\npractically recognizes three degrees of culpable homicide. The first is, what\n\nmay be called, `culpable homicide of the first degree'. This is the gravest\n\nform of culpable homicide, which is defined in <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 300</a> as `murder'.\n\nThe second may be termed as `culpable homicide of the second degree'.\n\nThis is punishable under the first part of <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 304</a>. Then, there is\n\n`culpable homicide of the third degree'. This is the lowest type of culpable\n\nhomicide and the punishment provided for it is also the lowest among the\n\npunishments provided for the three grades. Culpable homicide of this degree\n\nis punishable under the second part of <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 304</a>.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_18\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                    5</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">\f8.     The academic distinction between `murder' and `culpable homicide\n\nnot amounting to murder' has always vexed the Courts. The confusion is\n\ncaused, if Courts losing sight of the true scope and meaning of the terms\n\nused by the legislature in these sections, allow themselves to be drawn into\n\nminute abstractions. The safest way of approach to the interpretation and\n\napplication of these provisions seems to be to keep in focus the keywords\n\nused in the various clauses of <a href=\"/doc/305371/\" id=\"a_11\">Sections 299</a> and <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_12\">300</a>. The following\n\ncomparative table will be helpful in appreciating the points of distinction\n\nbetween the two offences.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_20\">\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">               Section 299                                          Section 300\n\n\n\nA person commits culpable homicide                          Subject to certain exceptions\nif the act by which the death is caused is done-    culpable homicide is murder\n                                                    if the act by which the\n                                                    death is caused is done -\n\n\n                                            INTENTION\n\n\n        (a) with the intention of causing          (1) with the intention of\n           death; or                               causing death; or\n\n\n        (b) with the intention of causing          (2) with the intention of\n          such bodily injury as is likely          causing such bodily injury\n          to cause death; or                            as the offender knows to be\n                                                          likely to cause the death of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                             6</span>\n\f                                                            the person to whom the harm\n                                                            is caused;\n                                                             or\n\n\n                                                            (3) With the intention of\n                                                            causing bodily injury to any\n                                                            person and the bodily injury\n                                                            intended to be inflicted\n                                                                   is sufficient in the\n                                                                            ordinary course   of\n           nature\n                                                            to cause death; or\n\n\n                                      KNOWLEDGE\n                                                ****\n\n\n      (c) with the knowledge that the act       (4) with the knowledge that\n          is likely to cause death.                       the act is so imminently\n                                                            dangerous that it must in all\n                                                            probability cause death or\n                                                            such bodily injury as is\n                                                            likely to cause death, and\n                                                            without any excuse for\n                                                            incurring the risk of causing\n                                                            death or such injury as is\n                                                            mentioned above.\n\n\n\n\n</pre><p id=\"p_21\">9.   Clause (b) of <a href=\"/doc/305371/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 299</a> corresponds with clauses (2) and (3) of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 300</a>. The distinguishing feature of the mens rea requisite under\n\nclause (2) is the knowledge possessed by the offender regarding the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                            7</span>\n\fparticular victim being in such a peculiar condition or state of health that the\n\ninternal harm caused to him is likely to be fatal, notwithstanding the fact\n\nthat such harm would not in the ordinary way of nature be sufficient to\n\ncause death of a person in normal health or condition. It is noteworthy that\n\nthe `intention to cause death' is not an essential requirement of clause (2).\n\nOnly the intention of causing the bodily injury coupled with the offender's\n\nknowledge of the likelihood of such injury causing the death of the\n\nparticular victim, is sufficient to bring the killing within the ambit of this\n\nclause. This aspect of clause (2) is borne out by illustration (b) appended to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 300</a>.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_22\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">10.   Clause (b) of <a href=\"/doc/305371/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 299</a> does not postulate any such knowledge on\n\nthe part of the offender. Instances of cases falling under clause (2) of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 300</a> can be where the assailant causes death by a fist blow\n\nintentionally given knowing that the victim is suffering from an enlarged\n\nliver, or enlarged spleen or diseased heart and such blow is likely to cause\n\ndeath of that particular person as a result of the rupture of the liver, or\n\nspleen or the failure of the heart, as the case may be. If the assailant had no\n\nsuch knowledge about the disease or special frailty of the victim, nor an\n\nintention to cause death or bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                     8</span>\n\fnature to cause death, the offence will not be murder, even if the injury\n\nwhich caused the death, was intentionally given. In clause (3) of <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_18\">Section\n\n300</a>, instead of the words `likely to cause death' occurring in the\n\ncorresponding clause (b) of <a href=\"/doc/305371/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 299</a>, the words \"sufficient in the\n\nordinary course of nature\" have been used. Obviously, the distinction lies\n\nbetween a bodily injury likely to cause death and a bodily injury sufficient\n\nin the ordinary course of nature to cause death. The distinction is fine but\n\nreal and if overlooked, may result in miscarriage of justice. The difference\n\nbetween clause (b) of <a href=\"/doc/305371/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 299</a> and clause (3) of <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 300</a> is one of\n\nthe degree of probability of death resulting from the intended bodily injury.\n\nTo put it more broadly, it is the degree of probability of death which\n\ndetermines whether a culpable homicide is of the gravest, medium or the\n\nlowest degree. The word `likely' in clause (b) of <a href=\"/doc/305371/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 299</a> conveys the\n\nsense of probable as distinguished from a mere possibility. The words\n\n\"bodily injury.......sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death\"\n\nmeans that death will be the \"most probable\" result of the injury, having\n\nregard to the ordinary course of nature.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_24\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_25\">11.   For cases to fall within clause (3), it is not necessary that the offender\n\nintended to cause death, so long as the death ensues from the intentional\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                      9</span>\n\fbodily injury or injuries sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of\n\nnature. Rajwant and Anr. v. State of Kerala, (AIR 1966 SC 1874) is an apt\n\nillustration of this point.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_26\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_27\">12.    <a href=\"/doc/1296255/\" id=\"a_23\">In Virsa Singh v. State of Punjab</a>, (AIR 1958 SC 465), Vivian Bose,\n\nJ. speaking for the Court, explained the meaning and scope of clause (3). It\n\nwas observed that the prosecution must prove the following facts before it\n\ncan bring a case under <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 300</a>, \"thirdly\". First, it must establish quite\n\nobjectively, that a bodily injury is present; secondly the nature of the injury\n\nmust be proved. These are purely objective investigations. Thirdly, it must\n\nbe proved that there was an intention to inflict that particular injury, that is\n\nto say, that it was not accidental or unintentional or that some other kind of\n\ninjury was intended. Once these three elements are proved to be present, the\n\nenquiry proceeds further, and fourthly it must be proved that the injury of\n\nthe type just described made up of the three elements set out above was\n\nsufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. This part of the\n\nenquiry is purely objective and inferential and has nothing to do with the\n\nintention of the offender.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_28\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                     10</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_29\">\f13.   The ingredients of clause \"Thirdly\" of <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 300</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_26\">IPC</a> were brought\n\nout by the illustrious Judge in his terse language as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      \"To put it shortly, the prosecution must prove the following\n      facts before it can bring a case under <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 300</a>, \"thirdly\".\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      First, it must establish, quite objectively, that a bodily injury is\n      present.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      Secondly, the nature of the injury must be proved.

This\n      part of the enquiry is purely objective and inferential and has\n      nothing to do with the intention of the offender.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p_30\">14.   The learned Judge explained the third ingredient in the following\n\nwords (at page 468):\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_31\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_32\">             \"The question is not whether the prisoner intended to\n             inflict a serious injury or a trivial one but whether he\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                     11</span>\n\f             intended to inflict the injury that is proved to be present.\n</p><p id=\"p_33\">             If he can show that he did not, or if the totality of the\n             circumstances justify such an inference, then of course,\n             the intent that the section requires is not proved. But if\n             there is nothing beyond the injury and the fact that the\n             appellant inflicted it, the only possible inference is that\n             he intended to inflict it. Whether he knew of its\n             seriousness or intended serious consequences, is neither\n             here or there. The question, so far as the intention is\n             concerned, is not whether he intended to kill, or to inflict\n             an injury of a particular degree of seriousness but\n             whether he intended to inflict the injury in question and\n             once the existence of the injury is proved the intention to\n             cause it will be presumed unless the evidence or the\n             circumstances warrant an opposite conclusion.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_34\">15.   These observations of Vivian Bose, J. have become locus classicus.\n\nThe test laid down by Virsa Singh's case (supra) for the applicability of\n\nclause \"Thirdly\" is now ingrained in our legal system and has become part\n\nof the rule of law. Under clause thirdly of <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 300</a> IPC, culpable\n\nhomicide is murder, if both the following conditions are satisfied: i.e. (a)\n\nthat the act which causes death is done with the intention of causing death\n\nor is done with the intention of causing a bodily injury; and (b) that the\n\ninjury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature\n\nto cause death. It must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that\n\nparticular bodily injury which, in the ordinary course of nature, was\n\nsufficient to cause death, viz., that the injury found to be present was the\n\ninjury that was intended to be inflicted.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_35\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                      12</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_36\">\f16.   Thus, according to the rule laid down in Virsa Singh's case, even if\n\nthe intention of accused was limited to the infliction of a bodily injury\n\nsufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature, and did not extend\n\nto the intention of causing death, the offence would be murder. Illustration\n\n</p><p id=\"p_37\">(c) appended to <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 300</a> clearly brings out this point.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_38\">17.   Clause (c) of <a href=\"/doc/305371/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 299</a> and clause (4) of <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 300</a> both require\n\nknowledge of the probability of the act causing death. It is not necessary for\n\nthe purpose of this case to dilate much on the distinction between these\n\ncorresponding clauses. It will be sufficient to say that clause (4) of <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_32\">Section\n\n300</a> would be applicable where the knowledge of the offender as to the\n\nprobability of death of a person or persons in general as distinguished from\n\na particular person or persons - being caused from his imminently\n\ndangerous act, approximates to a practical certainty. Such knowledge on\n\nthe part of the offender must be of the highest degree of probability, the act\n\nhaving been committed by the offender without any excuse for incurring the\n\nrisk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_39\">18.   The above are only broad guidelines and not cast iron imperatives. In\n\nmost cases, their observance will facilitate the task of the Court. But\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                     13</span>\n\fsometimes the facts are so intertwined and the second and the third stages so\n\ntelescoped into each other that it may not be convenient to give a separate\n\ntreatment to the matters involved in the second and third stages.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_40\">19.   The position was illuminatingly highlighted by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/605891/\" id=\"a_33\">State of\n\nAndhra Pradesh v. Rayavarapu Punnayya and Anr</a>. (1976 (4) SCC 382),\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1506749/\" id=\"a_34\">Abdul Waheed Khan @ Waheed and Ors. v.

Considering the factual scenario and the facts that one arrow was shot\n\n      the offence is covered by <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 304</a> Part I IPC and not <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 302</a>\n\n      IPC. Though it cannot be laid down that whenever one arrow is shot\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 302</a> IPC will not apply, on the facts of the present case it\n\n      appears to be so. Therefore, conviction is altered from <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 302</a>\n\n      IPC to <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 304</a> Part I IPC.

The High Court, however, as noticed hereinbefore, by reason of the impugned\n\n        judgment, reversed the said order dated 01st December 2007, inter alia, relying on or on the\n\n        basis of the decisions of this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/320135/\" id=\"a_1\">Pankaja &amp; Anr. v.

Mr. Amar Dave, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant would\n\n        submit that the High Court committed a serious error in passing the impugned judgment\n\n        insofar as it failed to take into consideration that the plaintiff-respondents, by reason of the\n\n        said application for amendment of the plaint, sought to change the entire nature and\n\n        character of the suit. According to the learned counsel, the plaintiff-respondents in their\n\n        suit proceeded on the basis that they were in possession of the plot No.29-B, i.e., the plot in\n\n        suit. However, as no order of injunction had been passed in the said suit, as had been\n\n        prayed for by the deceased respondent and furthermore in view of the fact that an order of\n\n        injunction had been passed in favour of the appellant in its suit, they have not only sought\n\n        to implead the Town Planner as a party defendant in the suit but had prayed for an\n\n        alternative relief to grant allotment of an alternative plot in the event they are not found to\n\n        be in possession of the said plot.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_17\">C.A.No.154/09 @ SLP(C)No.9931/08 .... (contd.)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                       -5-</span>\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">        10.          Mr. K.K. Trivedi, learned counsel appearing for the respondents would contend\n\n        that whereas the appellant herein had filed a suit questioning the legality and/or validity of\n\n        the Town Planning Scheme, in effect and substance, by reason of the amendment sought\n\n        for in the plaint, the deceased respondent prayed for implementation of the Town Planning\n\n        Scheme. In that view of the matter, the learned counsel would contend that neither only\n\n        the question of limitation arises but also if the amendment of the plaint, as prayed for, is\n\n        allowed, the real issue between the parties would be determined as a result whereof\n\n        multiplicity of proceedings can be avoided.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_19\">        11.          It is unfortunate that two suits filed by the parties hereto as far back as in 1985\n\n        are still pending before the learned Civil Judge for one reason or the other. The fact,\n\n        however, remains that the deceased-respondent who were was not a party to the appellant's\n\f        suit being Suit No.617 of 1985, had filed a suit subsequent thereto only with a prayer of\n\n        grant of permanent injunction.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_20\">        12.          In the year 2003, long after the deceased respondent's prayer for injunction had\n\n        been rejected, his legal representatives filed the aforementioned application for amendment\n\n        of the plaint. A bare perusal of the prayers made in the said application clearly goes to\n\n        show that by reason thereof the no prayer has been claimed by the respondents as against\n\n        the appellant herein. The alternative prayer, if it is to be granted, can be granted only\n\n        against the Corporation as Town\n\nC.A.No.154/09 @ SLP(C)No.9931/08 ....

Respondents, we may notice, in their counter affidavit filed before us themselves\n\n        have categorically stated that they, in law, are entitled to take recourse to such remedies as\n\n        are available to them for the purpose of grant of allotment of an alternative plot and/or for\n\n        implementation of the Town Planning Scheme. If they had an independent cause of action\n\n        against the Corporation either in its capacity as a town planner or as a local authority, in\n\n        our opinion, the same by itself cannot be a ground for filing an application for amendment\n\n        in the suit pending between the parties wherein, inter alia, the question of possession, inter\n\n        se, is required to be determined.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_22\">        14.          The High Court as also the learned counsel appearing for the respondents, as\n\n        noticed hereinbefore, have strongly relied upon the decision of this Court in the case of\n\n        Pankaja (supra) wherein relying on or on the basis of a decision of this Court in the case of\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/908527/\" id=\"a_3\">L.J. Leach &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Jardine Skinner &amp; Co</a>. AIR 1957 SC 357, this Court opined that\n\f        in an application for amendment of the plaint it may have to be kept in mind that the\n\n        discretionary jurisdiction in that behalf can be exercised by the court even if the suit is\n\n        barred by limitation.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_23\">\n\nC.A.No.154/09 @ SLP(C)No.9931/08 ....

It is neither in doubt nor in dispute that the court's jurisdiction to consider an\n\n        application for amendment of pleading is wide in nature, but, when, by reason of an\n\n        amendment, a third party is sought to be impleaded not only the provisions of O.VI R.17,\n\n        Code of Civil Procedure (C.P.C.) but also the provisions of O.I R.10, C.P.C. would come\n\n        into play. When a new party is sought to be added, keeping in view the provisions of sub-\n\n        rule (5) of Rule 10 of Order I, C.P.C., the question of invoking the period of limitation\n\n        would come in.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_25\">        16.          The High Court, in our opinion, in a case of this nature, should not have\n\n        interfered with the discretionary jurisdiction exercised by the learned 3rd Additional Sr.\n\n        Civil Judge. The question as to whether an application for amendment should be allowed\n\n        in spite of delay and laches in moving the same, would depend upon the facts and\n\n        circumstances of each case wherefor a judicial evaluation would be necessary.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_26\">        17.          The decision in the case of     Pankaja (supra) itself is an authority for that\n\n        proposition. So far as the decision in the case of Sampat Kumar (supra) is concerned, this\n\n        Court has struck a bit different note therein as it was observed :\n\n\n\n</p>                 \"10. An amendment once incorporated relates back to the date of the suit.<p id=\"p_27\">\n</p><p id=\"p_28\">                 However, the doctrine of relation-back in the context of amendment of\n                 pleadings is not one of universal application and in appropriate cases the court\n                 is competent while permitting an amendment to direct that the amendment\n                 permitted by it shall not relate back to the date of the suit and to the extent\n                 permitted by it shall be deemed to have been brought before the court on the\n                 date on which the application\n\fC.A.No.154/09 @ SLP(C)No.9931/08 ....

[See observations in <a href=\"/doc/1556317/\" id=\"a_4\">Siddalingamma v.\n                 Mamtha Shenoy</a> (2001) 8 SCC 561].\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_29\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_30\">        18.          There cannot be any doubt or dispute that an application for amendment of the\n\n        plaint seeking to introduce a cause of action which had arisen during the pendency of the\n\n        suit stands on a different footing than the one which had arisen prior to the date of\n\n        institution of the suit. We have noticed hereinbefore that the plaintiff-respondents in their\n\n        application for amendment of the plaint themselves accepted the fact that the appellant\n\n        herein not only had filed a suit prior in point of time to the suit filed by the deceased\n\n        respondent but had also obtained an injunction as a result whereof they did not obtain\n\n        effective possession of the suit land. If that be so, in our opinion, the plaintiff-respondents\n\n        in effect and substance are seeking to alter the basic structure of the suit which in the case\n\n        of Sampath Kumar (supra) itself has been held to be impermissible.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_31\">        19.          For the reasons aforementioned, we are of the opinion that the High Court\n\n        committed a jurisdictional error in interfering with the well considered judgment and order\n\n        of the learned 3rd Additional Sr. Civil Judge rejecting the application filed by the\n\n        respondents for amendment of the plaint. The impugned judgment is, therefore, set aside\n\n        and the appeal is allowed.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_32\">\n\nC.A.No.154/09 @ SLP(C)No.9931/08 ....

Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the\n\nMadhya Pradesh High Court upholding the conviction of the appellant for\n\noffence punishable under Section 302 read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 34</a> of the Indian\n\nPenal Code, 1860 (in short the `<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a>') as was awarded by learned Additional\n\nSessions Judge, Panna, in Sessions Trial No.15/1992.\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">\f3.    Prosecution version as unfolded during trial is as follows:\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">      On 30th November, 1991 at about 5.00 p.m. Ram Kishore (hereinafter\n\nreferred to as the `deceased') was murdered in an agricultural field. First\n\nInformation Report was lodged by Manik Lal at Police Station, Pawal in the\n\nevening at about 7.00 p.m. Offence was registered as Crime No.124/91\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_4\">34</a> IPC. Deceased had eloped with Lalli, sister of\n\nRamcharan (A-2) and both of them had performed court marriage. The court\n\nmarriage was registered and Lalli was living with Ramkishore. The\n\nappellant was having enmity with deceased on account of aforesaid\n\nincident. Deceased after eloping with Lalli was living in some other village\n\nand returned to his village a month before the incident. Ramkishore had\n\ngone to answer the call of nature in the evening on 30.11.1991 at about 4.30\n\np.m. towards the agricultural field of Gadka. Around 5 p.m. Phulla (A-3)\n\narmed with axe, Ramcharan (A-2) armed with sword alongwith\n\nDayashankar (A-1) and Munni Lal (A-4) went to the field of Gadaka. Munni\n\nLal and Dayashankar were barehanded. Phulla gave axe blow on the head of\n\ndeceased. Thereafter, Dayashankar and Munnilal, the co-accused pulled the\n\nlegs of deceased and threw him on the ground. Ram Kishore fell on the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                    2</span>\n\fcrops in the field. Ramcharan assaulted the deceased by sword on the chest.\n\nThen he placed his sword on the chest of the deceased. On account of\n\nbeating he died. Police after receiving information of the commission of\n\ncrime carried out the investigation, arrested the accused persons and filed\n\nthe challan on 3.1.1992 before the Court of Judicial Magistrate. Case was\n\ncommitted to the Court of Sessions Judge. Trial Court framed charges under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_6\">34</a> IPC against the accused persons. After recording the\n\nevidence the trial Court convicted the accused persons for offence under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_7\">Sections 302</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 34</a> IPC and sentenced them as afore-noted.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">      Before the High Court the basic stand was that the prosecution failed\n\nto prove common intention on the part of the appellants and, therefore,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 34</a> had no application. The individual act of the appellant should\n\nhave been considered. Merely because the appellant had accompanied other\n\naccused persons, that cannot be sufficient to warrant presumption of\n\ncommon intention.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">4.    Learned counsel for the State submitted that the eye witnesses PWs 2\n\nand 3 had described the act of each of the appellants and the role ascribed to\n\nthe appellant was that he pulled the leg of the deceased as a result of which\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                     3</span>\n\fdeceased fell in the field of Masur crop and thereafter he was assaulted by\n\nother accused persons. The appeal was dismissed accepting the stand of the\n\nState.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">5.       Learned counsel for the appellant re-iterated the stand taken before\n\nthe High Court and submitted that <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 34</a> IPC has no application.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">6.       Learned counsel for the State on the other hand supported the\n\njudgment.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">7.       <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 34</a> has been enacted on the principle of joint liability in the\n\ndoing of a criminal act. The Section is only a rule of evidence and does not\n\ncreate a substantive offence. The distinctive feature of the Section is the\n\nelement of participation in action. The liability of one person for an offence\n\ncommitted by another in the course of criminal act perpetrated by several\n\npersons arises under <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 34</a> if such criminal act is done in furtherance of\n\na common intention of the persons who join in committing the crime. Direct\n\nproof of common intention is seldom available and, therefore, such\n\nintention can only be inferred from the circumstances appearing from the\n\nproved facts of the case and the proved circumstances. In order to bring\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                      4</span>\n\fhome the charge of common intention, the prosecution has to establish by\n\nevidence, whether direct or circumstantial, that there was plan or meeting of\n\nmind of all the accused persons to commit the offence for which they are\n\ncharged with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 34</a>, be it pre-arranged or on the spur of\n\nmoment; but it must necessarily be before the commission of the crime. The\n\ntrue contents of the Section are that if two or more persons intentionally do\n\nan act jointly, the position in law is just the same as if each of them has done\n\nit individually by himself. As observed in <a href=\"/doc/673120/\" id=\"a_14\">Ashok Kumar v. State of Punjab</a>\n\n(AIR 1977 SC 109), the existence of a common intention amongst the\n\nparticipants in a crime is the essential element for application of this\n\nSection. It is not necessary that the acts of the several persons charged with\n\ncommission of an offence jointly must be the same or identically similar.\n\nThe acts may be different in character, but must have been actuated by one\n\nand the same common intention in order to attract the provision.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">8.    The Section does not say \"the common intention of all\", nor does it\n\nsay \"and intention common to all\". Under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 34</a> the\n\nessence of the liability is to be found in the existence of a common intention\n\nanimating the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance\n\nof such intention. As a result of the application of principles enunciated in\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                      5</span>\n\f<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 34</a>, when an accused is convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 302</a> read with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 34</a>, in law it means that the accused is liable for the act which\n\ncaused death of the deceased in the same manner as if it was done by him\n\nalone. The provision is intended to meet a case in which it may be difficult\n\nto distinguish between acts of individual members of a party who act in\n\nfurtherance of the common intention of all or to prove exactly what part was\n\ntaken by each of them. As was observed in <a href=\"/doc/865810/\" id=\"a_19\">Ch. Pulla Reddy and Ors. v.\n\nState of Andhra Pradesh</a> (AIR 1993 SC 1899), <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 34</a> is applicable even\n\nif no injury has been caused by the particular accused himself. For applying\n\n<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 34</a> it is not necessary to show some overt act on the part of the\n\naccused.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_17\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">9.    The evidence of PWs 2 and 3 did not attribute any overt act to the\n\nappellant. The mere fact that he was in the company of the accused who\n\nwere armed would not be sufficient to attract <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 34</a> IPC. It is\n\nundisputed that appellant was not armed and he had no animosity with the\n\ndeceased. This position is also accepted by the prosecution. Additionally,\n\nthe stand that he pulled the leg of the deceased has not been established.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                     6</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">\f10.   In the peculiar facts of the case therefore it would be appropriate that\n\nthe appellant cannot be held guilty by application of <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 34</a> IPC. His\n\nconviction is accordingly set aside. He be set at liberty forthwith unless\n\nrequired to be in custody in connection with any case.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">11.

Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of the Division Bench of\n\nthe Gujarat High Court upholding the conviction of the appellant for\n\noffence punishable under Section 20 (b)(ii) of the Narcotic Drugs and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1\">Psychotropic Substances Act</a>, 1985 (in short the \"<a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_2\">NDPS Act</a>\"). The learned\n\nAdditional Sessions Judge, Bharuch had found him guilty under the\n\faforesaid provision for having committed the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1330288/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 8(c)</a> of\n\nthe NDPS Act. Minimum sentence of 10 years' rigorous imprisonment and\n\na fine of Rs.1,00,000/- with default stipulation was imposed.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p_3\">2.    The appellant, who is the original accused in Sessions Case No. 84 of\n\n1996, was charged for having committed offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1557102/\" id=\"a_4\">Section\n\n20(b)</a> (ii) of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_5\">NDPS Act</a>, on the basis of a complaint lodged by one PSI\n\nKD Pandya, LCB Branch, Aharuch District, Complainant in Course of\n\ninvestigation of one snottier offence, registered vide CR No, II 135 of 1995,\n\nunder the NDPS act, came to know that accused is also possessing and\n\nselling the contraband articles at his residence. Upon such information he\n\nand other Officers started for raid.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p_4\">3.    Initially, he informed about having received such information to the\n\nhigher officers, namely D.S.P. and Circle Inspector of Bharuch District, by\n\nwriting a report in a sealed envelope, and sent it through one Police\n\nConstable.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p_5\">4.    On the basis of the said report, entry came to be recorded in Jambusar\n\nPolice Station Diary at SL. No.17 of 1995 at about 2.30 P.M., the raid was\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                       2</span>\n\feffected on 15. 12.1995 after calling panchas and other officers and a\n\nphotographer, and after undertaking other exercise required under law.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p_6\">5.    The raiding party led by Mr. Pundya, PSI, went to the residence of\n\naccused, bearing Bharuch Municipal House No, 3132. The door of the\n\nhouse was open, and one person standing there was questioned, who replied\n\nthat his name was Hamidbhai Azambhai Malik, the accused and the\n\nappellant before us. After introducing himself, he prepared a memorandum,\n\nto the effect as to whether, accused would like his house to be searched in\n\npresence of an Executive Magistrate or a Gazetted Officer, to which,\n\naccused replied in the nagative. Since, accused had no objection, before\n\nstarting search, PSI Pandya, took the signature of the accused on the\n\nmemorandum, produced at Exh. 29.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p_7\">6.    Thereafter, the house was searched in presence of- Panchas, and a\n\nladies purse containing 17 closed plastic small bags were found out,\n\ncontaining small tablets. Out of 17, the 16 small plastic bags contained the\n\nsame weight. Plastic bags were opened and verified and weighed in\n\npresence of panchas, photographs were taken and again they were placed in\n\nthe plastic bags. It was apprehended that on account of the unpleasant odour\n\nand smell, it seemed to be contraband articles like 'Charas'. The necessary\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                   3</span>\n\fprocedure for seizure was undertaken and after the procedure was followed,\n\nthe seal of LCB Branch, Bharuch was applied on the cover. The total weight\n\nof the contraband articles, like charas came to 4,900 mgs. The sealed\n\nmudammal contraband articles charas thereafter was forwarded to the\n\nDirector of Forensic Science Laboratory, for examination and report, who\n\nupon examination reported, it to be falling within the prohibited and\n\ncontraband article under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_6\">NDPS Act</a> i.e. `Charas'. The FSL authority\n\nhad, also, verified the seal and it tallied with the forwarding letter and the\n\nitem sent. Upon the basis of the report, the accused came to be charged as\n\nstated above.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p_8\">7.    In support of the prosecution case, the prosecution placed reliance on\n\nas many as nine prosecution witnesses and also on 21 documents. The\n\ndefence of the accused was of total denial. No defence evidence was led.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">Upon the analysis and appraisal of the evidence of the prosecution, the\n\nlearned Addl. Sessions Judge found accused guilty for having committed an\n\noffence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1557102/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 20(b)</a> (ii) of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_8\">NDPS Act</a>, and after\n\nhearing on the quantum of sentence, awarded minimum sentence prescribed\n\ni.e. 10 years rigorous imprisonment and a minimum fine of Rs.1,00,000/-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">and in default, to undergo further simple imprisonment of one year more.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                    4</span>\n<p id=\"p_11\">\f8.       The accused preferred an appeal before the high Court which was\n\ndismissed as aforestated. Primary stand was that the officer who conducted\n\nthe search was not authorized and was not an empowered officer. It was\n\npleaded that there was non-compliance with the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 42</a>\n\n(2) of the Act.\n</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_12\">9.       Learned counsel for the respondent-State on the other hand supported\n\nthe judgment of the trial court and affirmed by the High Court.\n</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_13\">10.      Before dealing with the factual aspect certain observations made by\n\nthis Court in <a href=\"/doc/1098587/\" id=\"a_10\">State of Punjab v. Baldev Singh</a> [1999(6) SCC 172] need to be\n\nnoted:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">               \"9.Sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 42</a> lays down that the\n               empowered officer, if has a prior information given by\n               any person, he should necessarily take it down in writing\n               and where he has reason to believe from his personal\n               knowledge that offences under Chapter IV have been\n               committed or that materials which may furnish evidence\n               of commission of such offences are concealed in any\n               building etc. he may carry out the arrest or search,\n               without a warrant between sunrise and sunset, and he\n               may do so without recording his reasons of belief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"p_14\">               10.The proviso to sub-section (1) lays down that if the\n               empowered officer has reason to believe that a search\n               warrant or authorisation cannot be obtained without\n               affording opportunity for the concealment of evidence or\n               facility for the escape of an offender, he may enter and\n               search such building, conveyance or enclosed place, at\n               any time between sunset and sunrise, after recording the\n               grounds of his belief. Vide sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 42</a>,\n               the empowered officer who takes down information in\n               writing or records the grounds of his belief under the\n               proviso to sub-section (1), shall forthwith send a copy of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                      5</span>\n\fthe same to his immediate official superior. <a href=\"/doc/1374738/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 43</a>\ndeals with the power of seizure and arrest of the suspect\nin a public place. The material difference between the\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/1374738/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 43</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 42</a> is that whereas\n<a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 42</a> requires recording of reasons for belief and\nfor taking down of information received in writing with\nregard to the commission of an offence before\nconducting search and seizure, <a href=\"/doc/1374738/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 43</a> does not\ncontain any such provision and as such while acting\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1374738/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 43</a> of the Act, the empowered officer has\nthe power of seizure of the article etc. and arrest of a\nperson who is found to be in possession of any narcotic\ndrug or psychotropic substance in a public place where\nsuch possession appears to him to be unlawful.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">17.The trial court in those cases had acquitted the\naccused on the ground that the arrest, search and seizure\nwere conducted in violation of some of the \"relevant and\nmandatory\" provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_19\">NDPS Act</a>. The High Court\ndeclined to grant appeal against the order of acquittal.\nThe State of Punjab thereupon filed appeals by special\nleave in this Court. In some other cases, where the\naccused had been convicted, they also filed appeals by\nspecial leave questioning their conviction and sentence\non the ground that their trials were illegal because of\nnon-compliance with the safeguards provided under\n<a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 50</a> of the NDPS Act. A two-Judge Bench\nspeaking through K. Jayachandra Reddy, J. considered\nseveral provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_21\">NDPS Act</a> governing arrest,\nsearch and seizure and, in particular, the provisions of\n<a href=\"/doc/1439062/\" id=\"a_22\">Sections 41</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_23\">42</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1374738/\" id=\"a_24\">43</a>, <a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_25\">44</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1798309/\" id=\"a_26\">49</a>, <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_27\">50</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1609866/\" id=\"a_28\">51</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1294540/\" id=\"a_29\">52</a> and <a href=\"/doc/669884/\" id=\"a_30\">57</a> of the\nNDPS Act as well as the provisions of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure relating to search and seizure\neffected during investigation of a criminal case. Dealing\nwith <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 50</a>, it was held that in the context in which\nthe right had been conferred, it must naturally be\npresumed that it is imperative on the part of the officer to\ninform the person to be searched of his right that if he so\nrequires he shall be searched before a gazetted officer or\nMagistrate and on such request being made by him, to be\ntaken before the gazetted officer or Magistrate for further\nproceedings. The reasoning given in Balbir Singh case1\nwas that to afford an opportunity to the person to be\nsearched \"if he so requires to be searched before a\ngazetted officer or a Magistrate\" he must be made aware\nof that right and that could be done only by the\nempowered officer by informing him of the existence of\nthat right. The Court went on to hold that failure to\ninform the person to be searched of that right and if he so\nrequires, failure to take him to the gazetted officer or the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                        6</span>\n\fMagistrate, would mean non-compliance with the\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 50</a> which in turn would \"affect the\nprosecution case and vitiate the trial\". The following\nconclusions were arrived at by the two-Judge Bench in\n<a href=\"/doc/795643/\" id=\"a_33\">State of Punjab v. Balbir Singh</a> [ 1994 (3) SCC 299]\n(SCC pp. 320-22, para         25)\n\n\n\n         \"25. The questions considered above arise\n    frequently before the trial courts. Therefore we find\n    it necessary to set out our conclusions which are as\n    follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">             (1) If a police officer without any prior\n         information as contemplated under the\n         provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_34\">NDPS Act</a> makes a search or\n         arrests a person in the normal course of\n         investigation into an offence or suspected\n         offences as provided under the provisions of\n         <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_35\">CrPC</a> and when such search is completed at\n         that stage <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 50</a> of the NDPS Act would\n         not be attracted and the question of complying\n         with the requirements thereunder would not\n         arise. If during such search or arrest there is a\n         chance recovery of any narcotic drug or\n         psychotropic substance then the police officer,\n         who is not empowered, should inform the\n         empowered officer who should thereafter\n         proceed in accordance with the provisions of\n         the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_37\">NDPS Act</a>. If he happens to be an\n         empowered officer also, then from that stage\n         onwards, he should carry out the investigation\n         in accordance with the other provisions of the\n         <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_38\">NDPS Act</a>.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">             (2-A) Under <a href=\"/doc/1200558/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 41(1)</a> only an\n         empowered Magistrate can issue warrant for\n         the arrest or for the search in respect of\n         offences punishable under Chapter IV of the\n         Act etc. when he has reason to believe that\n         such offences have been committed or such\n         substances are kept or concealed in any\n         building, conveyance or place. When such\n         warrant for arrest or for search is issued by a\n         Magistrate who is not empowered, then such\n         search or arrest if carried out would be illegal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"p_16\">         Likewise only empowered officers or duly\n         authorized officers as enumerated in <a href=\"/doc/1320494/\" id=\"a_40\">Sections\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                      7</span></a>\n\f<a href=\"/doc/1223622/\" id=\"a_41\">41(2)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/855593/\" id=\"a_42\">42(1)</a> can act under the provisions of\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_43\">NDPS Act</a>. If such arrest or search is made\nunder the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_44\">NDPS Act</a> by\nanyone other than such officers, the same\nwould be illegal.\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">(2-B) Under <a href=\"/doc/1223622/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 41(2)</a> only the empowered\nofficer can give the authorisation to his\nsubordinate officer to carry out the arrest of a\nperson or search as mentioned therein.

State, Panaji, Goa</a> [(1998) 8\n            SCC 655] a three-Judge Bench (to which one of us,\n            Sujata V. Manohar, J., was a party) once again\n            considered the requirements of <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_66\">Sections 42</a> and <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_67\">50</a> of the\n            Act. In that case the police officer \"accidentally\" reached\n            the house while on patrol duty and had it not been for the\n            conduct of the accused persons in trying to run into the\n            house on seeing the police party, he would perhaps not\n            have had any occasion to enter the house and effect\n            search. But when the conduct of the accused persons\n            raised a suspicion, he went into the house and effected\n            the search, seized the illicit material and caused the\n            arrest. The Court opined that in the facts and\n            circumstances of the case, when the investigating officer\n            accidentally stumbled upon the offending articles and\n            himself not being the empowered officer, then on\n            coming to know that the accused persons were in\n            possession of illicit articles, then from that stage\n            onwards he was under an obligation to proceed further in\n            the matter only in accordance with the provisions of the\n            Act. On facts it was found that the investigating officer\n            did not record the grounds of his belief at any stage of\n            the investigation, subsequent to his realising that the\n            accused persons were in possession of charas and since\n            he had made no record, he did not forward a copy of the\n            grounds to his superior officer nor did he comply with\n            the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 50</a> of the Act, inasmuch as he\n            did not inform the person to be searched that if he\n            required, his search could be conducted before a gazetted\n            officer or a Magistrate. The Bench held that for failure to\n            comply with the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_69\">Sections 42</a> and <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_70\">50</a>, the\n            accused was entitled to an order of acquittal and\n            consequently the appeal was allowed and the order of\n            conviction and sentence against the accused was set\n            aside.\"\n</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_27\">11.   Coming to the factual background it has to be noted as follows:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                   10</span>\n<p id=\"p_28\">\f            The search was made by the raiding party at about 4.30 P.M. on\n\n</p><p id=\"p_29\">      15. 12.1995. <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 42</a> will be invocable only if the search is made\n\n      by the police officer or the concerned authority, upon the prior\n\n      information. If such a person has reason to believe from personal\n\n      knowledge or information given by any person and obliged to take\n\n      down in writing as such the information about the accused having\n\n      possessed of and dealing with contraband article like 'charas' came to\n\n      be appraised of by the concerned PSI Mr. K,D,Pandya, LCB Branch\n\n      of Bharuch Police Station, in course of his investigation of an\n\n      offence, registered vide CR No.II-135 of 1995. Therefore, it is settled\n\n      proposition of law when such an information or intimation or\n\n      knowledge comes to the notice of the Investigating officer in course\n\n      of the regular patrolling or an investigation of some other offence, it\n\n      is not necessary to follow in all cases the conditions incorporated in\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 42</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_30\">12.   However, it may also be noted that by way of abundant precaution,\n\nthe PSI Mr. Pandya though he was investigating the offence registered with\n\nCR No. 135 of 1995 under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_73\">NDPS Act</a>, upon receipt of an intimation or\n\ninformation about the present offence, also noted down such an information\n\ntaken down in writing, which is produced at Exh. 30, and such information\n\nwas transmitted through a messenger immediately to the higher officers.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                   11</span>\n<p id=\"p_31\">\fNot only that this part of the procedure, by way of abundant precaution,\n\nexercised and followed by the PSI, is also manifestly recorded in the\n\ncomplaint at Exh.32.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_32\">13.   Additionally, the question as to whether the officer who conducted\n\nthe proceedings was empowered officer or not was not raised before the trial\n\ncourt and the High Court and, therefore, that plea cannot be entertained.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_33\">14.

Sant Surjan Singh is the founder of the said Gurudwara. He\n\nhad given the right of management of the said Gurudwara to Jagat Singh,\n\nwho died in an accident during his life time. On or about 6.5.1982, he\n\nexecuted a general power of attorney appointing (1) Balu Singh s/o Talok\n\nSingh (Nabardar), (2) Harbans Singh s/o Ram Singh; and (3) Sant Nand\n\nKaur widow of Jagat Singh as his attorneys in terms whereof they were\n\nconferred the powers to manage the whole of the property of the said\n\nGurudwara.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">      Clauses (3) and (4) of the said power of attorney read as under:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">             \"(3) If any member out of these members dies\n             then can elect another member with the acceptance\n             of majority.

No appeal\n            has been filed in the connected suit.

Appellant herein does not claim any right, title and interest in his\n\nindividual capacity.     He was the Vice-President of the Managing\n\nCommittee. Thus, for all intent and purport, he was also a plaintiff in Civil\n\nSuit No. 367-T/1996. The judgment and decree passed in the suit filed by\n\nSant Hari Singh might not have been binding upon the appellant herein had\n\nhe claimed any right or interest over the said property in his individual\n\ncapacity and not as a member of the Managing Committee. Indisputably,\n\nthe Managing Committee did not file any Second Appeal against the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                    7</span>\n\njudgment and decree passed against it. The said judgment and decree,\n\ntherefore, attained finality.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_29\">\n</p><p id=\"p_30\">13.   Both the suits, as noticed hereinbefore, were consolidated. They were\n\nheard together. The disputes between the parties to both the suits were\n\ncommon. The issues raised therein also were common.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_31\">      The Managing Committee filed a suit for declaration that it was in\n\nmanagement and control of the said Gurudwara Sahib and was entitled\n\nthereto as also a declaration that the respondent was not a Mohtmim of the\n\nsaid Gurudwara and, thus, not entitled to manage its affairs. As the said\n\ndecree had attained finality, it is binding on the appellants also. Appellants,\n\ntherefore, in law, were required to prefer another Second Appeal against the\n\njudgment and decree passed in the said suit. The principle of res judicata in\n\nthe aforementioned fact situation, in our opinion, has rightly been applied\n\nby the High Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_32\">\n</p><p id=\"p_33\">14.

Anil Kumar who opened savings\nbank account in that branch with account no.12291. On 3.4.2000, the respondent\npresented a chqeque drawn in his favour by Anil Kumar for a sum of Rs. 9.85 lakhs\nbefore Kunchithanni branch of the bank for collection and crediting the same in his\naccount. It is worth mentioning that on the date of issue of cheque, Anil Kumar had\nless than Rs.150/- in his account. The cheque was sent for collection to Chengannur\nbranch of\n                                                                                 ...2/-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                         -2-</span>\n<p id=\"p_4\">the bank through M/s. Professional Couriers but the same was lost in transit. The\nrespondent complained to the Manager of Kunchithanni branch of the bank about\nnon-credit of Rs.9.85 lakhs in his account and then filed a petition before the Banking\nOmbudsman for the State of Kerala. The Manager of the Kunchithanni branch of\nthe bank, vide his letter dated 5th June, 2000, informed the respondent that the cheque\nwas lost in transit and advised him to get a duplicate cheque in lieu of the lost\ninstrument. Thereafter, the Banking Ombudsman issued communication dated 10th\nJuly, 2000 to the respondent that there was no deficiency of service on the part of the\nbank and that he may take necessary steps to obtain duplicate cheque from the\ndrawer by invoking <a href=\"/doc/1337377/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 45A</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act or approach a\ncourt/appropriate forum for recovery of the money. However, instead of taking steps\nfor obtaining duplicate cheque from the drawer, namely, Anil Kumar, the respondent\nfiled a complaint before the State Commission claiming Rs.9.85 lakhs with interest\n@18% per annum. The bank contested the complaint by asserting that there was no\ndeficiency of service because it had asked the complainant to obtain duplicate cheque\nwhich he failed to do. The bank also questioned the bonafides of the complainant-\nrespondent by alleging that on the date of issue of cheque, the drawer had a negligible\namount of Rs.112/- in his account.\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">          The State Commission declined the respondent's prayer for award of\nRs.9.85 lakhs but directed the bank to pay interest @18% per annum on the cheque\namount from the date of its issue, i.e., 03.04.2000 till the date of payment. The\nNational Commission dismissed the appeal preferred by the appellant and confirmed\nthe order of the State Commission. Hence this appeal by special leave.\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">                                                                                  ...3/-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                         -3-</span>\n<p id=\"p_7\">           Learned counsel for the appellant invited our attention to the zerox copy of\nthe statement of account of Anil Kumar to show that between 28th March, 1998 and\n29th September, 2000 he did not deposit any amount in the bank; that outstanding\nbalance as on 28th March 1998 was Rs.148/- and as on 29th September, 1998 total\nbalance amount was Rs.87/- to his credit, and argued that the State Commission\ncommitted grave illegality in awarding interest to the complainant-respondent by\npresuming deficiency of service on the part of the appellant and ignoring the stark\nreality that on the date of presentation of the cheque and five months thereafter, there\nwas no possibility of its encashment. He pointed out that in spite of the\ncommunications of the bank and letter dated 10th July, 2000 of the Banking\nOmbudsman, the respondent did not take steps to obtain duplicate cheque from the\ndrawer apparently because he knew that the drawer did not have the requisite money\nfor encashment of the cheque and argued the award of interest on Rs.9.85 lakhs, by\nthe State Commission which has been confirmed by the National Commission is\nlegally unsustainable. As against this, learned counsel for the respondent supported\nthe impugned orders and argued that the State Commission has not committed any\nerror by awarding interest in lieu of the loss suffered by his client due to the\nappellant's failure to credit the cheque amount in his account.\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">           We have considered the respective submissions. In our view the State\nCommission was not at all justified in awarding interest to the respondent.\nUndisputedly the drawer, namely, Anil Kumar did not deposit any amount in the\nbank between 28th March, 1998 and the date on which the cheque is said to have been\nissued in favour of the respondent. Therefore, it was impossible for the respondent to\nget the amount credited in his account. If the cheque had not been lost in transit, the\nsame would have been dishonoured due to\n                                                                                   ...4/-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                          -4-</span>\n<p id=\"p_9\">insufficiency of funds. On its part, the bank had advised the respondent to obtain\nduplicate cheque from the drawer. Banking Ombudsman gave similar advise to the\nrespondent by pointing out that he can get duplicate cheque by resorting to <a href=\"/doc/1337377/\" id=\"a_2\">Section\n45A</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act. However, the respondent did not take any\nsteps whatsoever for obtaining duplicate cheque from Anil Kumar. The reason for\nthis is not far to see. Anil Kumar had sum less than Rs.200/- in his account at the\nrelevant time. The appellant was aware of this and, therefore, he did not resort to\n<a href=\"/doc/1337377/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 45A</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Not only this, he did not take any\naction for recovery of Rs.9.85 lakhs from Anil Kumar either by filing a complaint\nbefore appropriate forum or by filing a suit before the competent civil court.\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">           This being the position, the direction given by the State Commission for\npayment of interest to the respondent is liable to be set aside. Consequently, the order\nof the National Commission is also liable to be set aside.\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">           Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, impugned orders are set aside and the\ncomplaint filed before the State Commission is dismissed.\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">           No costs.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">                                                                         ......................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">                                                [B.N.

Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of the Andhra Pradesh\n\nHigh Court upholding the conviction of the appellant for offences\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_1\">Sections 498A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_2\">304B</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860\n\n(in short the `<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_3\">IPC</a>').

In appeal, A2 was acquitted by\n\nthe High Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">3.    Prosecution version in a nutshell is as follows:\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">      A1 the present appellant is the son of A2 who married Manjula\n\n(hereinafter referred to as the `deceased') the daughter of PWs.1 &amp; 2 about\n\nsix years prior to the date of incident. Sub Inspector of Police (PW9) of\n\nOsmania University Police Station received a message at 6.45 P.M. on\n\n8.2.1999 from Gandhi Hospital stating that one Manjula was admitted in the\n\nhospital allegedly having consumed unknown acid at her residence on the\n\nsaid date. He entered the same in G.D., went to the hospital and found that\n\nthe deceased was unable to speak due to acid burns in her throat. All his\n\nvisits on subsequent dates proved futile. Therefore, he deputed Constable\n\n(P.W.3) on 13-2-1999 to the hospital. Accordingly, he went to the hospital\n\nat 11 A.M. and recorded her statement-Ex.P2 and handed over the said\n\nstatement to P.W.9. On the basis of the said statement P.W.9 registered a\n\ncase in Cr.No.34 of 1999 under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_6\">Sections 498-A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_7\">307</a> IPC and issued\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                    2</span>\n\fFIR-Ex.P12 to all concerned. He visited the Gandhi Hospital and recorded\n\nstatement under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 161</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in\n\nshort the `Code') of the deceased under Ex.P13. He further examined\n\nP.Ws.1, 2 and others, visited the scene of offence, which is the house of the\n\ndeceased at Manikanteswar Nagar, but did not find any incriminating\n\nmaterial at the scene of offence and examined the neighbours. He sent a\n\nrequisition-Ex.P3 to P.W.4-XXII Metropolitan Magistrate, Hyderabad for\n\nrecording the dying declaration of the deceased. On receipt of requisition\n\nthe Magistrate visited the hospital at 7.20 P.M. and after obtaining\n\nendorsement of the doctor that patient was conscious and coherent and also\n\nafter putting some preliminary questions he recorded the dying declaration-\n\n(Ex.P4). Thereafter, P.W.9 arrested the accused on 23-03-1999 and sent\n\nthem to court, subsequently on 13-04-1999 on the instructions of Assistant\n\nCommissioner of Police he along with P.Ws.8 and 7 proceeded to\n\nGolanukonda village and exhumed the dead body of the deceased PW 7, the\n\nM.R.O. conducted inquest over the dead body of the deceased and Professor\n\n(PW 8), Forensic Medicine, Kakatiya Medical College, Waranga conducted\n\npostmortem examination. After completion of investigation police laid the\n\ncharge sheet for the offence as aforementioned.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                     3</span>\n\f      On committal, charges were framed against the accused; read over\n\nand explained to them in Telugu and they pleaded not guilty.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">      The prosecution in order- to prove its case examined P.Ws.1 to 13\n\nand marked Exs.P1 to P16. No oral or documentary evidence has been\n\nadduced on defense side.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">      The learned Sessions Judge after evaluating the evidence on record\n\nfound the accused guilty and convicted for the offence, as aforementioned.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">      The trial court relied primarily on the statement made before the Head\n\nConstable (PW3).       The statement recorded by him is Exh.P2. The\n\nMagistrate (PW 4) recorded the dying declaration. Placing reliance on the\n\nevidence more particularly on the dying declaration, the conviction was\n\nrecorded.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">      In appeal, the primary stand was that the evidence was insufficient to\n\nconvict A2 and that the dying declaration should not have been acted upon.\n\nThe High Court found substance in the plea that the evidence was not\n\nsufficient to convict A2, but found the evidence to be sufficient so far as A1\n\ni.e. present appellant is concerned.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                      4</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">\f4.    Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the evidence of the\n\nmagistrate (PW 4) should not have been accepted so far as the dying\n\ndeclaration is concerned. The medical evidence does not show that the\n\nvictim was in a position to give any statement.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_18\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">5.    In response, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the\n\nstatements made by the deceased that is Exhs.P2, P4 and P13 are consistent\n\nwith regard to the A1 pouring acid in the mouth of the deceased which\n\nresulted in her death.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_20\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">6.    The deceased breathed her last on 9.4.1999. The dead body was\n\nexhumed on 13.4.1999.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_22\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">7.    This is a case where the basis of conviction of the accused by the trial\n\nCourt was the dying declarations. The situation in which a person is on his\n\ndeathbed, being exceedingly solemn, serene and grave, is the reason in law\n\nto accept the veracity of his statement. It is for this reason that the\n\nrequirements of oath and cross-examination are dispensed with. Besides\n\nshould the dying declaration be excluded it will result in miscarriage of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                      5</span>\n\fjustice because the victim being generally the only eye-witness in a serious\n\ncrime, the exclusion of the statement would leave the Court without a scrap\n\nof evidence.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_24\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_25\">8.    Though a dying declaration is entitled to great weight, it is\n\nworthwhile to note that the accused has no power of cross-examination.\n\nSuch a power is essential for eliciting the truth as an obligation of oath\n\ncould be. This is the reason the Court also insists that the dying declaration\n\nshould be of such nature as to inspire full confidence of the Court in its\n\ncorrectness. The Court has to be on guard that the statement of the deceased\n\nwas not as a result of either tutoring or prompting or a product of\n\nimagination. The Court must be further satisfied that the deceased was in a\n\nfit state of mind after a clear opportunity to observe and identify the\n\nassailant. Once the Court is satisfied that the declaration was true and\n\nvoluntary, undoubtedly, it can base its conviction without any further\n\ncorroboration. It cannot be laid down as an absolute rule of law that the\n\ndying declaration cannot form the sole basis of conviction unless it is\n\ncorroborated. The rule requiring corroboration is merely a rule of prudence.\n\nThis Court has laid down in several judgments the principles governing\n\ndying declaration, which could be summed up as under as indicated in <a href=\"/doc/1007294/\" id=\"a_9\">Smt.\n\nPaniben v. State of Gujarat</a> (AIR 1992 SC 1817):\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_26\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                      6</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_27\">\f      (i)     There is neither rule of law nor of prudence that dying\n\ndeclaration cannot be acted upon without corroboration. [<a href=\"/doc/1940450/\" id=\"a_10\">See Munnu Raja\n\n&amp; Anr. v. The State of Madhya Pradesh</a> (1976) 2 SCR 764)]\n\n</p><p id=\"p_28\">      (ii)    If the Court is satisfied that the dying declaration is true and\n\nvoluntary it can base conviction on it, without corroboration. [<a href=\"/doc/853108/\" id=\"a_11\">See State of\n\nUttar Pradesh v. Ram Sagar Yadav and Ors</a>. (AIR 1985 SC 416) and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1683212/\" id=\"a_12\">Ramavati Devi v. State of Bihar</a> (AIR 1983 SC 164)]\n\n</p><p id=\"p_29\">      (iii)   The Court has to scrutinize the dying declaration carefully and\n\nmust ensure that the declaration is not the result of tutoring, prompting or\n\nimagination. The deceased had an opportunity to observe and identify the\n\nassailants and was in a fit state to make the declaration. [<a href=\"/doc/1159790/\" id=\"a_13\">See K.\n\nRamachandra Reddy and Anr. v. The Public Prosecutor</a> (AIR 1976 SC\n\n1994)]\n\n</p><p id=\"p_30\">      (iv)     Where the dying declaration is suspicious, it should not be\n\nacted upon without corroborative evidence. [<a href=\"/doc/137330/\" id=\"a_14\">See Rasheed Beg v. State of\n\nMadhya Pradesh</a> (1974 (4) SCC 264)]\n\n</p><p id=\"p_31\">      (v)     Where the deceased was unconscious and could never make\n\nany dying declaration, the evidence with regard to it is to be rejected. [See\n\nKaka Singh v State of M.P. (AIR 1982 SC 1021)]\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                                      7</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_32\">\f      (vi)   A dying declaration which suffers from infirmity cannot form\n\nthe basis of conviction.

(1981\n\n(2) SCC 654)\n\n</p><p id=\"p_33\">      (vii) Merely because a dying declaration does contain the details as\n\nto the occurrence, it is not to be rejected. [<a href=\"/doc/1072623/\" id=\"a_16\">See State of Maharashtra v.\n\nKrishnamurthi Laxmipati Naidu</a> (AIR 1981 SC 617)]\n\n</p><p id=\"p_34\">      (viii) Equally, merely because it is a brief statement, it is not to be\n\ndiscarded. On the contrary, the shortness of the statement itself guarantees\n\ntruth. [See Surajdeo Oza and Ors. v. State of Bihar (AIR 1979 SC 1505).\n\n</p><p id=\"p_35\">      (ix)   Normally the Court in order to satisfy whether the deceased\n\nwas in a fit mental condition to make the dying declaration looks up to the\n\nmedical opinion. But where the eye-witness said that the deceased was in a\n\nfit and conscious state to make the dying declaration, the medical opinion\n\ncannot prevail. [<a href=\"/doc/33955999/\" id=\"a_17\">See Nanahau Ram and Anr. v. State of Madhya Pradesh</a>\n\n(AIR 1988 SC 912)].\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_36\">      (x)    Where the prosecution version differs from the version as given\n\nin the dying declaration, the said declaration cannot be acted upon. [<a href=\"/doc/307132/\" id=\"a_18\">See\n\nState of U.P. v. Madan Mohan and Ors</a>. (AIR 1989 SC 1519)].\n\n</p><p id=\"p_37\">      (xi)   Where there is more than one statement in the nature of dying\n\ndeclaration, one first in point of time must be preferred. Of course, if the\n\nplurality of dying declarations could be held to be trustworthy and reliable,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                                     8</span>\n\fit has to be accepted.

In the background of the principles set out above, the inevitable\n\nconclusion is that the trial court and the High Court have rightly convicted\n\nthe appellant for offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_20\">Sections 498A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_21\">304B</a> IPC.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_40\">10.

By reason of an Award dated 1.8.1988, the Labour Court directed his\n\nreinstatement in service with continuity therein but without attendant\n\nbenefits and back wages.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">5.    Pursuant to or in furtherance of the said Award, appellant was\n\nreinstated in service. However, he was not paid his salary at par with his\n\ncolleagues whose services had been regularized with effect from 1.10.1983.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">6.    He filed an Execution Petition being E.P. No. 18 of 1989 in I.D. No.\n\n581 of 1987 before Labour Court, Hyderabad praying that his services be\n\ndirected to be regularized at par with his colleagues with effect from\n\n1.10.1983. The said Execution Petition was allowed.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">7.    As despite the same, his pay was not fixed at par with his colleagues\n\nand no notional increments had been granted, a legal notice was issued on\n\nhis behalf by an Advocate on 2.3.1992.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">      He thereafter filed a writ petition before the High Court which was\n\nmarked as Writ Petition No. 21410 of 2002 praying for grant of notional\n\nincrements for the period between 1.10.1983 and 15.2.1989.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                   4</span>\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">      By reason of a judgment and order dated 29.10.2002, the said writ\n\npetition was allowed by a learned single judge of the High Court, directing:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">            \"The controversy in this writ petition is no more\n            res integra, in view of the decision of a Division\n            Bench of this Court in APSRTC, Khammam\n            Region and another Vs. P. Nageswara Rao. The\n            Division Bench while dealing an analogous\n            question has held that when an award was passed\n            by the labour court directing the respondents to\n            reinstate the petitioner into service, the action of\n            the respondent - Corporation in fixing the pay\n            without taking into consideration the notional\n            increments is illegal. It is further held that the\n            Corporation cannot rely on any circular or\n            regulation that takes away the plain meaning of the\n            award in the judgment.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p_19\">8.    A writ appeal was preferred thereagainst by the respondent herein.\n\nHowever, the said writ appeal was barred by limitation and an application\n\nfor condonation of delay having not been allowed, the same was dismissed.\n\nA Special Leave Petition filed thereagainst being Special Leave Petition\n\n(Civil) No. 1114 of 2004 was allowed by a judgment and order dated\n\n13.2.2007 in terms whereof the matter was remitted to the High Court for\n\ndisposal of the case on merit. By reason of the impugned judgment, the writ\n\nappeal preferred by the respondent herein has been allowed.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                    5</span>\n\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">9.    Ms. T. Anamika, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant\n\nwould urge that in view of the fact that the appellant was denied back wages\n\nonly by the Labour Court and having been reinstated in service with\n\ncontinuity, the High Court committed a serious error in declining to grant\n\nnotional increments in his favour from the date of his dismissal till the date\n\nof passing of the Award. Strong reliance in this behalf has been placed on\n\nthe decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1542335/\" id=\"a_3\">Devendra Pratap Narain Rai Sharma vs. State\n\nof Uttar Pradesh &amp; ors</a>. [AIR 1962 SC 1334].\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_21\">\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">10.   Mr. D. Mahesh Babu, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nrespondents, on the other hand, supported the impugned judgment.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">11.   The award appeared to have been passed by the labour court on\n\nconsent of the parties. Appellant himself stated so in his affidavit in support\n\nof the writ petition.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_24\">\n</p><p id=\"p_25\">12.   The terms of the consent order have not been produced before us by\n\nthe appellant. We will, however, proceed on the premise that the parties\n\nthereto agreed that the appellant would be reinstated within a month from\n\nthe said date. Appellant was, therefore, not only denied back wages but also\n\nthe attendant benefits.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                    6</span><p id=\"p_26\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_27\">13.   Interpretation of terms of consent will depend upon the nature of the\n\nlis and the background events.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_28\">\n</p><p id=\"p_29\">14.   Appellant, as noticed hereinbefore, had not only foregone back wages\n\nbut also attendant benefits. The word \"attendant benefits\" should be given\n\nits natural meaning. The \"attendant benefits\" was in regard to a period for\n\nwhich he had been denied back wages. A person may be denied back wages\n\nwhich otherwise can be interpreted to mean that he would be entitled to\n\nclaim the benefit of increments notionally.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_30\">15.   We may, however, notice that in <a href=\"/doc/309814/\" id=\"a_4\">A.P. State Road Transport\n\nCorporation &amp; ors. vs. Abdul Kareem</a> [(2005) 6 SCC 36], this Court held:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">            \".....the Labour Court specifically directed that the\n            reinstatement would be without back wages. There\n            is no specific direction that the employee would be\n            entitled to all the consequential benefits.\n            Therefore, in the absence of specific direction in\n            that regard, merely because an employee has been\n            directed to be reinstated without back wages, he\n            cannot claim a benefit of increments notionally\n            earned during the period when he was not on duty\n            during the period when he was out of service. It\n            would be incongruous to suggest that an\n            employee, having been held guilty and remained\n            absent from duty for a long time, continues to earn\n            increments though there is no payment of wages\n            for the period of absence.\"\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                     7</span>\n\n<p id=\"p_31\">16.   <a href=\"/doc/273787/\" id=\"a_5\">In A.P.

We find merit in the submission so made.\n              There is a difference between an order of\n              reinstatement accompanied by a simple direction\n              for continuity of service and a direction where\n              reinstatement is accompanied by a specific\n              direction that the employee shall be entitled to all\n              the consequential benefits, which necessarily flow\n              from reinstatement or accompanied by a specific\n              direction that the employee shall be entitled to the\n              benefit of the increments earned during the period\n              of absence. In our opinion, the employee after\n              having been held guilty of unauthorised absence\n              from duty cannot claim the benefit of increments\n              notionally earned during the period of\n              unauthorised absence in the absence of a specific\n              direction in that regard and merely because he has\n              been directed to be reinstated with the benefit of\n              continuity in service.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"p_33\">17.   In Devendra Pratap Narain Rai Sharma (supra), this Court upon\n\nreferring to Rule 54 of the Fundamental Rules framed by the State of Uttar\n\nPradesh, held as under:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_34\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">              \"11. In our view, this contention is wholly\n              misconceived. Rule 54, as amended in 1953,\n              stands as follows :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">                     \"54.(1) When a Government servant who\n              has been dismissed, removed or suspended is\n              reinstated, the authority competent to order the\n              reinstatement shall consider and make a specific\n              order--\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">                     (a) regarding the pay and allowances to be\n              paid to the Government servant for the period of\n              his absence from duty and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">                     (b) whether or not the said period shall be\n              treated as a period spent on duty.</blockquote><p id=\"p_35\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                        8</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_36\">       (2) Where such competent authority holds\nthat the Government servant has been fully\nexonerated or, in the case of suspension, that it\nwas wholly unjustified, the Government servant\nshall be given the full pay to which he would have\nbeen entitled, had he not been dismissed, removed\nor suspended, as the case may be together with any\nallowances of which he was in receipt prior to his\ndismissal, removal or suspension.\n</p><p id=\"p_37\">       (3) In other cases, the Government servant\nshall be given such proportion of such pay and\nallowances as such competent authority may\nprescribe.\n</p><p id=\"p_38\">       Provided that the payment of allowances\nunder clauses (2) and (3) shall be subject to all\nother conditions under which such allowances are\nadmissible.\n</p><p id=\"p_39\">       (4) In a case falling under clause (2) the\nperiod of absence from duty shall be treated as the\nperiod spent on duty for all purposes.\n</p><p id=\"p_40\">       (5) In a case falling under clause (3) the\nperiod of absence from duty shall not be treated as\nperiod spent on duty unless such competent\nauthority specifically directs that it shall be so\ntreated for any specified purposes.\"\n</p><p id=\"p_41\">This rule has no application to cases like the\npresent in which the dismissal of a public servant\nis declared invalid by a civil court and he is\nreinstated. This rule, undoubtedly enables the\nState Government to fix the pay of a public\nservant whose dismissal is set aside in a\ndepartmental appeal. But in this case the order of\ndismissal was declared invalid in a civil suit. The\neffect of the decree of the civil suit was that the\nappellant was never to be deemed to have been\nlawfully dismissed from service and the order of\nreinstatement was superfluous, The effect of the\nadjudication of the civil court is to declare that the\nappellant had been wrongfully prevented from\nattending to his duties as a public servant. It would\nnot in such a contingency be open to the authority\nto deprive the public servant of the remuneration\nwhich he would have earned had he been\npermitted to work.\"\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                     9</span><p id=\"p_42\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_43\">      The said decision, in our opinion, has no application to the fact\n\nsituation obtaining in the present case.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_44\">\n</p><p id=\"p_45\">18.   Appellant has not been directed to be reinstated in service by reason\n\nof an Award holding that the order of termination was wholly illegal and,\n\nthus, void ab initio. On what premise, parties entered into a compromise is\n\nnot known. It is possible to hold that findings of the Enquiry Officer which\n\nmight have been accepted by the disciplinary authority holding him guilty\n\nof misconduct had not been set aside; the Management might have thought\n\nthat denial of back wages and attendant benefits would be sufficient\n\npunishment. If that be so, appellant being not in service during the period in\n\nquestion, namely, 1.10.1983 to 15.2.1989, in our opinion, would not be\n\nentitled to increment.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_46\">\n</p><p id=\"p_47\">19.

Leave granted.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">2.    Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a Division Bench of\n\nthe Bombay High Court dismissing the writ petition filed. The writ petition\n\nwas filed by the appellant questioning legality of the order passed by the\n\fMaharashtra    Industrial   Development      Corporation   (in   short   the\n\n`Corporation') dated 30.3.2005.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">3.    Background facts in a nutshell are as follows:\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">      By Resolution dated 17.8.2004 a decision was taken for allotment of\n\nland at a particular price. The money was deposited on 9.3.2005 but letter\n\ndated 30.3.2005 was written to M/s. Everest Realtors Private Ltd. intimating\n\nthem that the request for allotment of land in the Airoli, Navi,\n\nKnowledge/Apparel Park cannot be considered. The pay orders submitted\n\nalong with letter dated 9.3.2005 were returned. According to the appellant\n\nno reason or basis has been indicated and the High Court misconstrued the\n\nprayer in the writ petition as if it was for enforcement of specific\n\nperformance of contract with the Corporation.            The appellant has\n\ncategorically stated that the subject matter of challenge was the impugned\n\ndecision taken by the Corporation to repudiate the contract. The High Court\n\nerroneously, according to the appellant came to hold that it can be\n\nconsidered by a civil court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                     2</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">\f4.    Learned counsel for the appellant further submitted that no reason has\n\nbeen indicated as to why the Corporation decided not to go ahead with the\n\ncontract.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">5.    Learned counsel for the Corporation on the other hand submitted that\n\nthe Corporation decided not to take any note of the payments made by M/s.\n\nEverest Realtors Private Ltd. In fact the Resolution earlier related to the\n\npresent appellant.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">6.    It is clarified by learned counsel for the appellant that he is a Director\n\nof the Pvt. Ltd. Co. and therefore, the reasons indicated have no relevance.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">7.    We find that this is a case which could have been decided by the High\n\nCourt and therefore we set aside the impugned order of the High Court. The\n\nwrit petition shall be restored for disposal on merit. To avoid unnecessary\n\ndelay, let the parties appear before the High Court on 9.2.2009.           The\n\nHon'ble Chief Justice of the High Court is requested to direct listing of the\n\npetition before an appropriate bench. It is made clear that we have not\n\nexpressed any opinion on the merits of the case. Till 9.2.2009 no third\n\nparties' interest shall be created by the Corporation.

Eight accused, namely, (1) Fateh Singh, (2) Ram\n\nChander, (3) Brahma, (4) Satvir, (5) Ram Saran, (6) Harbir,\n\n(7) Pratap and (8) Genda were tried by learned VI Additional\n\nDistrict &amp; Sessions Judge, Meerut, in Sessions Trial No. 70\n\nof 1978 for committing the murder of Hari Dutt Singh.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_4\">2.   By judgment and order dated 05.12.1979, the learned\n\ntrial judge convicted all the accused under Section 302 read\n\nwith <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 149</a> of the Indian Penal Code (for short \"<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a>\")\n\nand sentenced each to imprisonment for life.

The High Court by final\n\njudgment   and      order   dated   25.02.2003   modified   the\n\njudgment of the trial court.

The   incident   leading       to the   prosecution      of the\n\nappellant occurred on 31.10.1977 at about 4 P.M. in the\n\njungle of village Ahmadpuri, Police Station Parikshatgarh,\n\nDistrict Meerut (U.P.). The report of the incident was lodged\n\nby Mahendra Singh (PW-1) an eyewitness, son of the\n\ndeceased Hari Dutt Singh at about 5.30 P.M. in the Police\n\nStation in which the names of all the accused persons were\n\nmentioned.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">6.

It was the prosecution case that Mahabir son of Ram\n\nSaran was murdered in the year 1976 and for the said\n\nincident; Hari Dutt Singh [deceased] and his son PW-1 were\n\nfacing trial before the Court. One more criminal case filed\n\nby Smt. Sammo is pending against the deceased and PW-1\n\nin the Court of a Magistrate at Meerut.     On the day of\n\nincident, i.e. 31.10.1977, both PW-1 and Hari Dutt Singh\n\nhad gone to the Court of Magistrate at Meerut to attend the\n\nproceedings in the said case but the same was adjourned at\n\nabout 12 0'Clock in the noon.    PW-1 and his father had\n\nreturned to their village by bus.    After getting down at\n\nParikshatgarh, they started going to their village Ahmadpuri\n\non foot. At about 4 P.M., they reached on the road dividing\n\nthe fields of Balley and Muley where PW-1 was going about\n\n20 paces ahead of his father. The accused persons hiding\n\nthemselves in the sugarcane fields of Balley, suddenly\n\nappeared and laid down Hari Dutt Singh on the ground.\n\nAppellant Satvir, accused Ram Saran and accused Harbir\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                           5</span>\n\n\neach were armed with knives with which they inflicted fatal\n\ninjuries on Hari Dutt Singh at the instigation of accused\n\nRam Saran, who proclaimed that the life of Hari Dutt Singh\n\nshould be cut short as he was responsible for the murder of\n\nhis son Mahabir.    PW-1 shouted and raised alarm which\n\nattracted Bakhtawar Singh (PW-2), Ganga Saran (PW-4),\n\nGajraj and few more persons to the place of occurrence. All\n\nthe accused persons had fled from the place of incident\n\nafter committing the murder of Hari Dutt Singh. One Jasbir\n\nSingh recorded the report (Ex. Ka-1) of the incident at the\n\ninstance of PW-1 on the basis of which First Information\n\nReport came to be lodged at Police Station at about 5.30\n\nP.M.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">8.     Head Constable Satya Pal Singh (PW-6), who at the\n\nrelevant time, was discharging the duties of A.S.I., Police\n\nStation Parikshatgarh visited the scene of incident and\n\nprepared Panchnama (Ex. Ka-6), Khaka-lash (Ex.-Ka-7) and\n\nSite Plan (Ex.-Ka-9) of the dead body and collected blood-\n\nstained sample of earth from the place of occurrence.\n\nConstable Sukhpal (PW-5) alongwith Constable Baburam\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                             6</span>\n\n\ntook the dead body of Hari Dutt Singh to Hospital for post\n\nmortem.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">9.    Dr. O.P.

On internal examination, small intestine was found\n\nstabbed at two places and large intestine stabbed at one\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                               7</span>\n\n\nplace. Left lobe of liver was also stabbed. According to the\n\nopinion of the Doctor, the deceased died due to shock and\n\nhaemorrhage as a result of ante-mortem injuries.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">11.   On completion of the investigation, chargesheet was\n\nfiled against the accused persons by Station House Officer\n\nBijendra Singh Chahar (PW-7).\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">12.   All the accused pleaded not guilty to the charges and\n\nclaimed to be tried.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_17\">13.   The prosecution, in order to substantiate its case,\n\nexamined as many as 7 witnesses, out of whom Mahendra\n\nSingh (PW-1), Bakhtawar Singh (PW-2) and Ganga Saran\n\n(PW-4) are the eyewitnesses.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_18\">14.   The accused in the statements recorded under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_7\">Section\n\n313</a>     of   the   Criminal   Procedure   Code   denied    the\n\nincriminating evidence appearing against them.            Their\n\ndefence was denial simpliciter and pleaded false implication\n\ndue to enmity. No defence witness has been examined by\n\nthem.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_19\">15.   The trial court on appraisal of the entire evidence on\n\nrecord held all the accused guilty of the charges and\n\nconvicted them as aforesaid.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                             8</span><p id=\"p_20\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">16.   Being aggrieved, the accused had filed appeal before\n\nthe High Court. The High Court, as stated above, allowed\n\nthe appeal of accused Ram Chander, Brahma, Pratap and\n\nGenda and, accordingly, set aside their conviction and\n\nsentences, whereas the conviction of the appellant-Satvir,\n\nRam Saran and Harbir is converted from <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 302</a> read\n\nwith <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 149</a> and <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 148</a> IPC to <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 302</a> read\n\nwith <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 34</a> IPC. They were sentenced to suffer rigorous\n\nimprisonment for life.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_22\">17.   Feeling aggrieved thereby and dissatisfied with the\n\njudgment of the High Court, this appeal has been filed by\n\nappellant Satvir in this Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_23\">18.   Mr. Shakil Ahmed Syed, learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the appellant, contended that the evidence\n\nappearing on record against the appellant is verbatim\n\nversion to that which was taken into consideration with\n\nregard to the acquittal of four accused and, therefore, the\n\ncase of the appellant cannot be decided on any other scale\n\nand should have been treated at par with the evidence\n\nappearing against the acquitted persons. The appellant and\n\nother accused persons have been implicated by PW-1 in a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                              9</span>\n\n\nfalse case due to previous enmity as he alongwith deceased\n\nwas an accused in the murder of Mahabir, son of Ram\n\nSaran.   According to the learned counsel, the High Court\n\nhas committed grave error in convicting the appellant on\n\nthe same set of evidence, on the basis of which four\n\naccused, namely, Ram Chander, Brahma, Pratap and\n\nGenda have been acquitted and, therefore, the judgment of\n\nthe High Court suffers from factual and legal infirmity and\n\nperversity. The learned counsel then contended that the\n\nconduct of the alleged eyewitnesses, namely, PW-1, PW-2\n\nand PW-4 is so unnatural and casual that they witnessed\n\nthe entire incident as silent spectators and did not make\n\nany attempt to save the life of Hari Dutt Singh at the hands\n\nof the accused.     Therefore, no implicit reliance can be\n\nplaced on the evidence of these witnesses, who are not\n\ntrustworthy.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_24\">19.   Mr. T.N.Singh, Advocate appearing on behalf of the\n\nState, has canvassed correctness of the views taken by the\n\ntrial judge which were confirmed by the High Court.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_25\">20.   In order to appreciate the aforesaid rival contentions of\n\nthe learned counsel for the parties, we have independently\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                            10</span>\n\n\nscrutinized the oral and documentary evidence appearing\n\non record.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_26\">21.   Mahendra Singh (PW-1) has clearly stated that at the\n\ntime and on the day of incident he was with his father when\n\nthe appellant and other accused suddenly attacked the\n\ndeceased. He categorically stated that the appellant and his\n\ntwo companions Ram Chander and Harbir had inflicted\n\nknife injuries on the person of his father. He has given the\n\nnames of all the accused persons in the report on the basis\n\nof which FIR came to be registered in the Police Station.\n\nPW-2 Bakhtawar Singh who is an independent witness\n\ndeposed that on the day of incident when he was going to\n\nhis village Bhadauli from village Kaili, on the way he heard\n\nan alarm raised by PW-1 and saw the appellant, Ram Saran\n\nand Harbir inflicting knife injuries to Hari Dutt Singh.\n\nSuggestion of the accused that he was not present at the\n\nplace of incident or he had not seen the incident or that he\n\nis deposing falsely due to relationship, has been denied by\n\nhim. PW-4 Ganga Saran Singh deposed that on the day of\n\nincident he witnessed the accused giving beatings to Hari\n\nDutt Singh in between the fields of Balley and Muley. The\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                            11</span>\n\n\nappellant alongwith Ram Saran and Harbir had inflicted\n\nknife injuries on the person of Hari Dutt Singh. The\n\neyewitnesses have been cross-examined at length by the\n\nlearned counsel, but nothing tangible has been extracted\n\nfrom their evidence to create any shadow of doubt that they\n\nare not truthfulness witnesses. They have given reliable,\n\nconsistent and creditable version of the crime and their\n\nevidence inspires confidence.    It is well-settled that if the\n\nwitness is related to the deceased, his evidence has to be\n\naccepted if found to be reliable and believable because he\n\nwould inter alia be interested in ensuring that real culprits\n\nare punished.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_27\">22.   On a careful and cautious scrutiny of the evidence of\n\nPW-1, PW-2 and PW-4, we find their evidence concise,\n\nprecise and satisfactory on the point that they had seen the\n\nappellant, Ram Saran and Harbir causing grievous injuries\n\nto Hari Dutt Singh with knife which each was carrying with\n\nhim and due to the fatal injuries, he died on the spot. The\n\nevidence of these three eyewitnesses is neither embellished\n\nnor embroidered. We find no particular reason as to why\n\nPW-1, PW-2 and PW-4 have falsely deposed against the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                              12</span>\n\n\nappellant. The trial court as well as the High Court have\n\nrightly held that there was a motive for the accused to\n\ncommit murder of Hari Dutt Singh because as per the\n\nprosecution evidence, they were nursing a grudge against\n\nthe deceased because of his involvement in the commission\n\nof murder of Mahabir son of Ram Saran. The report of the\n\nincident has been promptly lodged by PW-1 in the Police\n\nStation in which the name of all the accused persons and\n\nPW-2 and PW-4 being eyewitnesses were mentioned. Simply\n\nbecause the eyewitnesses did not make any attempt to save\n\nthe life of the deceased from the clutches of the accused\n\npersons, their abnormal conduct by itself cannot be taken\n\nas a ground to disbelieve and discard their testimony in\n\nregard to the genesis of the occurrence and the part played\n\nby the appellant and the other convicted persons in the\n\ncommission of the offence.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_28\">23   The   ocular   version    of   the   eyewitnesses   finds\n\ncorroboration from the evidence of Dr. O.P. Sharma who\n\nhas found abovesaid six injuries on the body of Hari Dutt\n\nSingh. As per the post mortem report placed on record by\n\nDr.O.P. Sharma, the deceased received three stab wounds\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                             13</span>\n\n\nand two incised wounds and in his opinion death of the\n\ndeceased had occurred due to shock and haemorrhage as a\n\nresult of ante-mortem injuries.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_29\">24.   On our independent examination of the judgment\n\ngiven by the trial court and confirmed by the High Court, we\n\nfind that both the courts have properly and rightly re-\n\nassessed and reappraised the entire evidence on record and\n\nwe find no infirmity or perversity in the findings recorded by\n\nthe courts below warranting interference. The High Court\n\nhas not found any reliable and clinching evidence led by the\n\nprosecution to prove the guilt of the acquitted-accused.\n\nTherefore, the contention that the appellant shall be held\n\nentitled to benefit of doubt in the same manner as other\n\nacquitted-accused have been given, cannot be accepted.\n\nThe occurrence, as spoken by the eyewitnesses, is fully\n\nestablished and the appellant alongwith Ram Saran and\n\nHarbir will be constructively liable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 302</a> read\n\nwith <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 34</a> IPC for the commission of the crime as fatal\n\ninjuries were inflicted by them with knives which they were\n\ncarrying in their hands at the time of commission of offence.\n\nThe fatal injuries were caused with dangerous weapons on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                             14</span>\n\n\nvital parts of the body of deceased which resultantly caused\n\nhis death.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_30\">25.   Learned counsel for the appellant lastly argued that\n\nthe appellant had no intention to murder the deceased,\n\ntherefore, no offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 302</a> IPC was made out\n\nagainst him and at the most it could be a case under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 304</a> Part-II IPC, cannot be accepted in view of the\n\nnature of injuries, the manner in which they were inflicted,\n\nthe weapons of offence used and the vital parts of the body\n\nof the deceased selected by the appellant and other two\n\nconvicted accused for causing the fatal injuries.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_31\">26.   We, thus, find no merit and substance in any of the\n\nsubmissions made on behalf of the appellant.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_32\">27.   In the result, for the afore-stated reasons, there is no\n\nmerit in this appeal and it is, accordingly, dismissed.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_33\">                                  ........................................J.\n                                  (Lokeshwar Singh Panta)\n\n\n\n                                  ........................................J.\n                                  (B.

Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the\n\nPunjab and Haryana High Court upholding the conviction of the appellants\n\nfor offences punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 and <a href=\"/doc/838469/\" id=\"a_1\">Section\n\n452</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the `<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a>'). Though they were\n\ncharged of several other offences they were acquitted of those charges. In\n\nthe appeal filed by the appellants before the High Court there were several\n\fco-accused i.e. Jagdish, Devinder, Balwan and Murti Devi. Accused Jagdish\n\nand Devinder who were convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 323</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 34</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/838469/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 452</a> IPC. The other two accused persons i.e. Balwan and Murti\n\nwere acquitted of all charges.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">3.    Prosecution version in a nutshell is as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">      On March 20, 2000 at 4.00 p.m. Man Singh was sitting near the gate\n\nof his house, while members of his family were present inside the house.\n\nHawa Singh, Parkash and Jagdish armed with swords, Balwan and\n\nDevender @ Raju armed with lathis, their sister Murti armed with rapri and\n\ntheir mother Gindori armed with pharsa came there. They entered the house\n\nand upon exhortation that a lesson be taught to Man Singh for getting them\n\nconvicted, Hawa Singh opened the attack with a sword with which he hit\n\nMan Singh on the head. This was followed by Parkash giving a blow with\n\nhis sword which hit Man Singh in the middle of his head. Jagdish also gave\n\na sword blow which hit Man Singh on the back of the head. When alarm\n\nwas raised Balwan hit Sajjan (PW-7) with a lathi on his forehead above left\n\neye. Devender @ Raju hit Sajjan (PW-7) with a lathi on his left leg. Murti\n\nand Gindori also inflicted injuries on Sajjan. They also caused grievous\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                         2</span>\n\finjuries to Anju and Sarti. Sajjan's younger brother Krishan and his uncle\n\nAzad Singh reached the spot to rescue them from the assailants. During the\n\ncourse of rescuing the injured, Azad Singh also sustained injuries. Some\n\ninjuries were also inflicted by complainant party on the accused in self\n\ndefence before the accused retreated from the spot with their respective\n\nweapons. After the occurrence was over, the injured were taken to Civil\n\nHospital, Bhiwani. On reaching the hospital Man Singh succumbed to his\n\ninjuries whereas the injured were medico legally examined. Anju and Sajjan\n\nwere medico legally examined by Dr. Arjun Chander Yadav (PW-1) at 6.35\n\np.m. and 8.15 respectively. Anju was found to have various injuries on her\n\nright hand.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">      The case was registered at Police Station Sadar, Bhiwani on the basis\n\nof the statement of Sajjan (PW-7) recorded by ASI Suraj Bhan at 10.50 p.m.\n\non the same evening at General Hospital, Bhiwani. FIR was recorded in\n\nrespect of offences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_6\">Sections 302</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_7\">148</a>, <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_8\">149</a>, <a href=\"/doc/838469/\" id=\"a_9\">452</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_10\">323</a>\n\nIPC. Special report was delivered at 3.50 a.m. on March 21, 2000.\n\nThereafter, the Investigating Officer took up the investigation by first\n\npreparing the inquest report on the dead body of deceased Man Singh. After\n\nthe inquest proceedings, post mortem was conducted by Dr. Ramesh Kumar\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                       3</span>\n\f(PW-4). The Medical Officer found several injuries on the body of Man\n\nSingh. In the opinion of the Medical Officer the death was caused due to\n\nhamorrhage and shock and injury to the brain. The accused were arrested on\n\nMarch 30, 2000 by Inspector Darshan Lal (PW-11). On the basis of their\n\nrespective disclosure statements, certain weapons were recovered from\n\npossession of the accused i.e. axes from Parkash and Hawa Singh, rapris\n\nfrom Jagdish and Devender @ Raju and a lathi from Balwan.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">      After completion of the investigation all the accused barring Murti\n\nwere sent up for trial. Murti was placed in column 2 of the report under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1412034/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 173</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short the `Code').\n\nShe was subsequently summoned to stand trial under <a href=\"/doc/1138947/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 319</a> of the\n\nCode. Charge was first framed against the accused on July 19, 2000 under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 302</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 149</a> IPC and other related offences. Charges\n\nwere reframed on January 25, 2001. By this time Murti Devi had been\n\nsummoned as accused. Finally charge was reframed on April 15, 2004. All\n\nthe accused persons were found guilty and convicted.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">      Before the High Court the specific stand was that <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 302</a> had no\n\napplication because there was free fight and the occurrence took place in\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                       4</span>\n\fcourse of sudden quarrel. The High Court accepted that there was a sudden\n\nquarrel and there were injuries on both sides. But it took the view that the\n\nappellants were apparently the aggressors and, therefore, the conviction\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 302</a> IPC was in order.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">4.    In support of the appeal, learned counsel for the appellants submitted\n\nthat after having recording a finding that there was free and open fight, the\n\nquestion as to who was the aggressor was really irrelevant and the fact that\n\nthe persons belonging to the complainant party received more injuries was\n\nalso really of no consequence.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">5.    Learned counsel for the respondent-State supported the judgment.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">6.    For bringing in operation of Exception 4 to <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 300</a> IPC it has to\n\nbe established that the act was committed without premeditation, in a\n\nsudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel without the\n\noffender having taken undue advantage and not having acted in a cruel or\n\nunusual manner.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_19\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                        5</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">\f7.    The Fourth Exception of <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 300</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_19\">IPC</a> covers acts done in a\n\nsudden fight. The said exception deals with a case of prosecution not\n\ncovered by the first exception, after which its place would have been more\n\nappropriate. The exception is founded upon the same principle, for in both\n\nthere is absence of premeditation. But, while in the case of Exception 1\n\nthere is total deprivation of self-control, in case of Exception 4, there is only\n\nthat heat of passion which clouds men's sober reasons and urges them to\n\ndeeds which they would not otherwise do.             There is provocation in\n\nException 4 as in Exception 1; but the injury done is not the direct\n\nconsequence of that provocation. In fact Exception 4 deals with cases in\n\nwhich notwithstanding that a blow may have been struck, or some\n\nprovocation given in the origin of the dispute or in whatever way the quarrel\n\nmay have originated, yet the subsequent conduct of both parties puts them\n\nin respect of guilt upon equal footing. A `sudden fight' implies mutual\n\nprovocation and blows on each side. The homicide committed is then\n\nclearly not traceable to unilateral provocation, nor in such cases could the\n\nwhole blame be placed on one side. For if it were so, the Exception more\n\nappropriately applicable would be Exception 1.          There is no previous\n\ndeliberation or determination to fight. A fight suddenly takes place, for\n\nwhich both parties are more or less to be blamed. It may be that one of them\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                          6</span>\n\fstarts it, but if the other had not aggravated it by his own conduct it would\n\nnot have taken the serious turn it did. There is then mutual provocation and\n\naggravation, and it is difficult to apportion the share of blame which\n\nattaches to each fighter. The help of Exception 4 can be invoked if death is\n\ncaused (a) without premeditation, (b) in a sudden fight; (c) without the\n\noffender's having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual\n\nmanner; and (d) the fight must have been with the person killed. To bring a\n\ncase within Exception 4 all the ingredients mentioned in it must be found. It\n\nis to be noted that the `fight' occurring in Exception 4 to <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 300</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_21\">IPC</a> is\n\nnot defined in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_22\">IPC</a>. It takes two to make a fight. Heat of passion\n\nrequires that there must be no time for the passions to cool down and in this\n\ncase, the parties have worked themselves into a fury on account of the\n\nverbal altercation in the beginning. A fight is a combat between two and\n\nmore persons whether with or without weapons. It is not possible to\n\nenunciate any general rule as to what shall be deemed to be a sudden\n\nquarrel. It is a question of fact and whether a quarrel is sudden or not must\n\nnecessarily depend upon the proved facts of each case. For the application\n\nof Exception 4, it is not sufficient to show that there was a sudden quarrel\n\nand there was no premeditation. It must further be shown that the offender\n\nhas not taken undue advantage or acted in cruel or unusual manner. The\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                         7</span>\n\fexpression `undue advantage' as used in the provision means `unfair\n\nadvantage'. These aspects have been highlighted in Dhirajbhai Gorakhbhai\n\nNayak v. State of Gujrat (2003 (5) Supreme 223], <a href=\"/doc/573457/\" id=\"a_23\">Parkash Chand v. State\n\nof H.P</a>. (2004 (11) SCC 381) and <a href=\"/doc/1070976/\" id=\"a_24\">Byvarapu Raju v. State of A.P. and Anr</a>.\n\n(2007 (11) SCC 218)\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">8.     From the facts of the case, it appears that the accused persons armed\n\nwith deadly weapons like swords, balwan, lathis, pharsa came to the house\n\nof the Man Singh on 20th March, 2000, at 4 p.m., to teach Man Singh a\n\nlesson for getting the accused persons convicted. After coming to the house\n\nof Man Singh, Hawa Singh opened the attack with the sword, with which he\n\nhit Man Singh on the head and ultimately Man Singh succumbed to his\n\ninjuries.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_22\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">9.     Exception 4 to <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 300</a> IPC applies in the absence of any\n\npremeditation. This is very clear from the wording of the exception itself.\n\nThe exception contemplates that the sudden fight shall start upon the heat of\n\npassion on a sudden quarrel but here, the accused party, being deadly\n\narmed, came with the intention of teaching Man Singh a lesson and in\n\nfurtherance of that, one of them, Hawa Singh, hit Man Singh on the head\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                        8</span>\n\fwith a sword, an attack with a deadly weapon on the vital part of the body\n\nand that proved to be a fatal blow.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_24\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_25\">10.    Therefore, Exception 4 to <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 300</a> has no application to the facts\n\nof the present case.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_26\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_27\">11.    The appellants have been rightly convicted in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 302</a>\n\nIPC.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_28\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_29\">12.

He had two sons,\n\n      namely, Rajiv Lochan Roy and Kamjit Roy. The property in the suit admeasured\n\n      16 Bighas 4 Kathas.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">              Rajiv Lochan executed two deeds of sale in 1982, in respect of about 4\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                        2</span>\n\nBighas of land, inter alia, contending that he had half share in the said property.\n\nIt is not in dispute that the family of Nakho Ram was governed by Dayabhaga\n\nSchool of Hindu Law. It is furthermore not in dispute that in 1982, Nakho Ram\n\nwas alive and he expired only in the year 1990. Appellant, however, claimed that\n\nin terms of the aforementioned deeds of sale executed by Rajiv Lochan in the year\n\n1982, he had remained in possession of the vested property since the date of\n\npurchase.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">         It is, furthermore, not in dispute that in the year 1990, a proceeding\n\nunder Section 107 as also <a href=\"/doc/1405190/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 145</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure was\n\ninitiated and therein, Respondent No.1 herein was put in possession of the\n\nproperty.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">         Respondent No.1 filed a suit in the year 1991 for declaration of his title,\n\nconfirmation of possession as also a decree for setting aside two deeds of sale\n\nexecuted by Rajiv Lochan in the year 1982. The said suit was dismissed by the\n\nlearned Trial Judge, inter alia holding that the legal representatives of the\n\nproforma respondents having not been brought on record, the suit had abated. It\n\nwas furthermore held that the defendant-appellant acquired title to the suit\n\nproperty by adverse possession. The suit so far as it related to setting aside the\n\naforementioned deeds of sale was, however, held to be barred by limitation.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">         The First Appellate Court, however, on an appeal preferred by the\n\ncontesting respondents, reversed the said findings of the Trial Court opining that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                         3</span>\n\nas the defendant-appellant was a party to the fraud perpetrated by Rajiv Lochan\n\nin so far as he was, at all material times, aware that in the year 1990, Nakho Ram\n\nwas alive and not dead, he cannot take benefit of the said deeds of sale and the\n\nsame were void ab initio. The High Court, as noticed hereinbefore, has affirmed\n\nthe said view.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">         Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant would contend\n\nthat the High Court committed a serious error in passing the impugned judgment\n\nin so far as it failed to take into consideration the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1907896/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 43</a> of the\n\nTransfer of Property Act, in terms whereof, having regard to the fact that Rajiv\n\nLochan had also died in the year 1992, the doctrine of feeding the estoppel\n\nbecame applicable to the facts of the present case.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">         A finding of fact has been arrived at by the First Appellate Court that\n\nthe appellant was also a party to the fraud inasmuch as he was all along aware\n\nthat on the date of execution of the deeds of sale, Nakho Ram was alive.\n\nIndisputably, therefore, the appellant entered into the aforementioned transaction\n\nknowing fully well that Nakho Ram was alive in the year 1992, Rajiv Lochan\n\ncould not have executed the deeds of sale and only with a view to obviate the legal\n\ndifficulties, Nakho Ram was shown to have expired.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">         Appellant was furthermore aware that although Rajiv Lochan did not\n\ninherit the property of Nakho Ram, he executed the aforementioned deeds of sale.\n\nRajiv Lochan, thus, having no title to the property, by said deeds of sale or\n\notherwise, evidently could not have derived any title thereover.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                         4</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">         <a href=\"/doc/1907896/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 43</a> of the Transfer of Property Act reads as under:\n\n        \"43.Transfer by unauthorised person who subsequently\n        acquires interest in property transferred.- Where a person\n        fraudulently or erroneously represents that he is authorised to\n        transfer certain immovable property and professes to transfer\n        such property for consideration,l such transfer shall, at the option\n        of the transferee, operate on any interest which the transferor may\n        acquire in such property at any time during which the contract of\n        transfer subsists.\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">                   Nothing in this section shall impair the right of\n        transferees in good faith for consideration without notice of the\n        existence of the said option.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_18\">\n\n         In this case, as the appellant averred that although in the deeds of sale, a\n\nstipulation was made by Rajiv Lochan that his father had expired, it cannot be\n\nsaid to be a case where he fraudulently or erroneously represented that he was\n\nauthorized to transfer the said immovable property. As noticed hereinbefore, a\n\nfinding of fact had been arrived at by the First Appellate Court that the appellant\n\nwas a party to the fraud and that he was not victim thereof.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">         Our attention, however, has been drawn to a decision of this Court in\n\n[2007 (2) SCC 404]. In the said decision this Court laid down the law in the\n\nfollowing terms:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">        \"12. In order to get the benefit of the said provision, the conditions\n        which must be satisfied are:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                   (1) the contract of transfer was made by a person who\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                 5</span>\n\n             was competent to contract; and\n           (2) the contract would be subsisting at the time when a\n             claim for recovery of the property is made.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_20\">13. However, the provisions would have no application if the\ntransfer was invalid as being forbidden by law or contrary to\npublic policy, as envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 23</a> of the Contract Act.\nThus, no estoppel can be pleaded contrary to the provisions of a\nstatute. The 'rule of feeding the estoppel' shall apply in absence\nthereof.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_21\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">14. The doctrine of feeding the estoppel envisages that 'where a\ngrantor has purported to grant an interest in land which he did\nnot at the time possess, but subsequently acquires, the benefit of\nhis subsequent acquisition, goes automatically to the earlier\ngrantee, or as it is usually expressed, feeds the estoppel'.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">15. The principle is based on an equitable doctrine that a person\nwho promised to perform more than he can perform must make\ngood his contract when he acquires the power of performance.\nThe difference between the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/584197/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 41</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1907896/\" id=\"a_6\">43</a> of the Act\nis apparent. Whereas <a href=\"/doc/584197/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 41</a> provides that a transfer by an\nostensible owner cannot be avoided on the ground that the\ntransferee should take reasonable care to ascertain that the\ntransferor had power to make the transfer and to act in good\nfaith before a benefit thereof if claimed by him. <a href=\"/doc/1907896/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 43</a>, on the\nother hand, enables the transferee to whom a transferor has made\na fraudulent or erroneous representation to lay hold, at his option,\nof any interest which the transferor may subsequently acquire in\nthe property, unless the right of any subsequent purchaser for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                            6</span>\n\n           value without notice is in effect.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_24\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_25\">                     Fraud vitiates all solemn acts.            As the appellant was aware\n\n  of the fact that Nakho Ram had not expired in 1992, in our opinion, the\n\n  provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1907896/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 43</a> of the Transfer of Property Act cannot be said to have\n\n  any application in the instant case.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_26\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_27\">           For the reasons aforementioned, this appeal is dismissed. However, there\n\n  shall be no order as to costs.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_28\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_29\">                                                 ..........................J\n                                                 (S.B.

This appeal has been filed\nagainst the order of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New\nDelhi dated 15.03.2002.\n</p><p id=\"p_2\">            The respondent had a business establishment at Vellappad in Trissur\nDistrict in the State of Kerala.     It took a Jeweller's Block Policy for Rs.\n1,15,00,000/-. During the currency of the policy, the complainant-respondent\nlodged a claim with the appellant for the loss of gold ornament weighing 587.870\ngrams. The claim was repudiated by the appellant on the ground that the loss of\ngold was occasioned as it was in the custody of an apprentice, who was not an\nemployee.\n</p><p id=\"p_3\">            The relevant clause in the Insurance Policy stated;\n</p><p id=\"p_4\">                 \"S. 11(a) property insured whilst in the custody of the\n    insured, his partner or his employees\".\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">            The question, therefore, is whether an apprentice is an employee.\n            The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has held\nthat an apprentice is an employee because Section 2 (6) of the Kerala Shops and\nCommercial Establishments Act defines an employee to include an\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                      -2-</span>\n\n\napprentice. The National Commission has also relied on the definition in the\n<a href=\"/doc/88376/\" id=\"a_1\">Employees State Insurance Act</a> and some other enactments.\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">            We are of the opinion that the view taken by the Natinal Commssion\nis not correct. The present case is covered solely by the contract of insurance.\nThat contract of insurance no doubt uses the word 'employee', but it does not say\nthat the word 'employee' in the contract of insurance will have the same meaning\nas in the Kerala Shops and Commercial Establishments Act or the <a href=\"/doc/88376/\" id=\"a_2\">Employees\nState Insurance Act</a> or any other enactment.\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">            In various enactments, the word 'employee', has no doubt, been\ndefined to include an apprentice, but that is only a deeming provision and a legal\nfiction by which the meaning of the word 'employee' has been extended.\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">            Legal fictions are well-knwon in law. For example, <a href=\"/doc/1715862/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 43</a> (3) of\nthe <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_4\">Income Tax Act</a> defines 'plant' to include a book. Ordinarily a plant means a\nfactory, and by no stretch of imagination can we call a factory a book. However,\nthe <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_5\">Income Tax Act</a> deems a book to be a plant for the purpose of depreciation.\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">            Many such illustrations of deeming clauses or legal fictions can be\ngiven.   The definition of employee in various enactments which include an\napprentice within the ambit of the definition is such a piece of legal fiction. That,\nhowever, does not mean that in common parlance an apprentice is an employee.\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">            In the present case, since the word 'employee' has not been defined in\nthe contract of insurance, we have to give it the meaning which it has in common\nparlance. In common parlance, an apprentice is a trainee and not an employee.\nEven if he is given a stipend, that does not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                              -3-</span>\n\n\n        mean that there is a relationship of master and servant between the firm and the\n        apprentice.     Hence, we cannot agree with the view taken by the National\n        Commission. In our view , the claim before the National Commission was not\n        maintainable.\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">                      Hence we set aside the order of the National Commission.\n                      The appeal is allowed. No orders as to costs.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p_12\">                                                            ......................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">                                              [MARKANDEY KATJU]\n\n\n\n                                                    .....................J\n                           [R.M.

This Writ\n\nPetition was filed on 1.5.2006 and notice thereof was issued on 11.5.2006\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                      2</span>\n\nand ever since then, number of interim orders in nature of directions came\n\nto be passed.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">3.       Shortly stated, the petitioner claiming itself to be an organization,\n\nwhich was started as a response to the alleged carnage which took place\n\nin Gujarat from 27.2.2002 onwards with the main objective to bridge the\n\ngap between the various religious communities, as also to ensure that\n\njustice is done to those who are the victims of communalism. It is claimed\n\nthat it had set up a Citizens Tribunal to go into the causes and extent of\n\ncommunal violence in Gujarat headed by two retired Hon'ble Judges of this\n\nCourt.     The petitioner has filed the Report of the said Tribunal, which\n\npublished in two volumes. The other contentions which are raised are that\n\nthe respondent No. 3 Shri P.C. Pandey was the Commissioner of Police,\n\nAhmedabad during the period when the communal disturbances rocked the\n\nState of Gujarat.     It is claimed that more than 700 persons died and\n\nnumber of irregularities were committed by Shri Pandey such as not\n\nsupplying the reinforcements and serious derelictions of his duties.\n\nNumber of other allegations have been made that Shri Pandey was sent on\n\ndeputation to CBI, which appointment was challenged before this Court by\n\nthe petitioner by filing Writ Petition (C) No. 147 of 2004, wherein, the Union\n\nof India had given an undertaking that he would not handle any cases\n\nrelating to Gujarat riots of 2002. He was accordingly not allowed to handle\n\nthose cases. It has also come in the allegations that on account of the\n\ndirections issued by this Court, about 2000 cases which were hastily closed\n\nby the then Gujarat Government, were directed to be re-opened and a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                    3</span>\n\nfresh scrutiny into those cases was also ordered. It was expresses that if\n\nShri Pandey continued in the highest post of Director General of Police,\n\nthose cases would be adversely affected and the guilty would be shielded\n\nand that would be patent denial of justice.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">4.    In its Counter Affidavit, the State of Gujarat opposed most of the\n\nclaims and pointed out that the claim that the appointment of respondent\n\nNo. 3 as a Director General of Police would be detrimental to the cause of\n\njustice, is not correct.   It is pointed out that the Review Committee\n\nconstituted under the directions of this Court earlier vide order dated\n\n17.8.2004 was required to look into all 2020 riot cases, wherein, the\n\ninvestigating agency had filed \"A\" Summary. It is further pointed out that\n\nShri Pandey was not in any manner connected with the Review Committee\n\nnor was he in a position to influence the same. It is further pointed out that\n\nup to the quarter ending 30th April, 2006, as many as 1989 cases out of the\n\naforesaid 2020 cases had already been reviewed in respect of which\n\nperiodic reports were filed by the Committee before this Court. It is claimed\n\nthat in all, hardly 30 \"A\" summary cases had remained and it was,\n\ntherefore, argued before us by the Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of\n\nthe State of Gujarat that there was no point in now taking exception to the\n\nappointment and continuation of the third respondent as the Director\n\nGeneral of Police. Learned Counsel also informed us during the debate\n\nthat even those 30 \"A\" summary cases have already been decided upon\n\nand, therefore, there is no scope for those cases being affected by Shri\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                     4</span>\n\nPandey in his continuation as the Director General of Police. It is further\n\nsubmitted at the Bar that Shri Pandey is going to retire on 31st March, 2009\n\nand under the circumstances, this Writ Petition itself has become\n\nredundant.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">5.    Considering the overall situation, firstly, the fact that almost all the\n\ncases in the \"A\" summary, which were recommenced by the investigating\n\nagency, have already been dealt with by the Scrutiny Committee and\n\nsecondly that Shri Pandey is going to retire on 31st March, 2009, we do not\n\npropose to continue with this Writ Petition. In fact, this Writ Petition has\n\nitself become redundant as the continuation of Shri Pandey as the DGP is\n\nof no consequence insofar as the apprehension expressed by the petitioner\n\nin the Writ Petition is concerned.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">6.    Shri P.P. Rao urged that if Shri Pandey continues to that post, he\n\nmay be in a position to pressurize the Courts, where, in pursuance of the\n\nrecommendations of the Scrutiny Committee, the prosecutions are in\n\nprogress. We do not think that such a thing can be said either regarding\n\nShri Pandey or even the Trial Courts in Gujarat. We do not have any\n\nreasons to believe that Shri Pandey, in his remaining tenure of about three\n\nmonths, would take any such steps. We do not think that the Trial Courts\n\nin Gujarat are capable of being pressurized in the manner expressed in the\n\nWrit Petition.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">7.    An appointment of a government servant is the prerogative of the\n\nparticular government, particularly, when it is a sensitive appointment of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                    5</span>\n\nDirector General of Police.     We, under the doctrine of `judicial review',\n\nwould not extend our hands to upset such an appointment, more\n\nparticularly, in the factual panorama which is available today. We hold that\n\nthe present Writ Petition has become redundant and we dispose it of as\n\nsuch.    As for any disciplinary action against Shri Pandey, it is for the\n\nconcerned government. We will not enter the fact finding exercise.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">8.      Shri Rao further expressed that the Government of Gujarat might\n\nextend the appointment by giving extension to Shri Pandey. We do not\n\nthink any such contention can be entertained at this stage, without there\n\nbeing any basis for the same.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">9.      In the result, the Writ Petition is disposed of in the light of\n\nobservations made hereinabove.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">                                             ......................................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">                                             (Markandey Katju)\n\n\n\n                                              ......................................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">                                             (V.S.

In our view, the impugned order is liable to be\n\n          set aside on a simple ground that while\n\n          deciding the Second Appeal, the High Court of\n\n          Madhya Pradesh had not considered a part of\n\n          the order of the Appellate Court, by which the\n\n          application filed by the appellant before the\n\n          Appellate Court under Order 41 Rule 27 of\n\n          the Code of Civil Procedure was rejected. It is\n\n          true that the First Appellate Court, while\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                        1</span>\n\f     deciding the First Appeal, had given reasons\n\n     for rejection of the said application but the\n\n     ground for such rejection was, as noted\n\n     hereinabove, not considered by the High\n\n     Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">3.   That being the position, we set aside the\n\n     Judgment of the High Court and direct it to\n\n     decide the appeal afresh on merits and in\n\n     accordance     with   law    along   with     the\n\n     application under Order 41 Rule 27 of the\n\n     CPC and the reasons given by the First\n\n     Appellate Court for its rejection.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">4.

This amount of compensation\n\nhas been calculated at the rate of Rs.3/- per square feet.\n\nIn   the   impugned    judgment,      the   High     Court   has\n\nmentioned that the claimant-appellant herein himself\n\nhad purchased the land in question on 24.3.1986 for\n\nRs.45,000/- which is based on calculation at the rate of\n\nRs.1.75 per square ft.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                                              3</span><p id=\"p_6\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">       The preliminary notification under section 4(1) of\n\nthe Act was issued a year later i.e. 20.5.1987.            The\n\nappellant relied on the sale deeds executed subsequently\n\nand that too for smaller pieces of lands meant for\n\nhousing sites being Ex.P.2 and that of 1990. The High\n\nCourt in the impugned judgment has rightly observed\n\nthat    Ex.P.2    cannot     be   taken    into   consideration\n\nparticularly keeping in view that the sale deed in respect\n\nof this very acquired land which was effected only a year\n\nago in 1986 itself was available as a ready basis for\n\ndetermining the market value of the land.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">       The High Court in the impugned judgment observed\n\nthat    after    giving    reasonable     deductions   towards\n\ndevelopment charges, the market rate can be safely taken\n\nas Rs.3/- per square feet since this price was even\n\nsuggested for the lands in question even by the\n\nrespondent - Housing Board to the claimant-witness.\n\nThe High Court granted compensation at the rate of\n\nRs.3/- per square feet.       The compensation in this case\n\nworked out to be Rs.1,30,680/- per acre. The High Court\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                                                   4</span>\n\n\nalso observed that the appellant - land owner will also be\n\nentitled to other statutory benefits and interest as per the\n\nprovisions contained under sections 23 and 28 of the Act.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">        The fact is that this very land was purchased by the\n\nappellant a year ago i.e. on 24.3.1986 for Rs.45,000/-\n\nand for the same land the High Court gave compensation\n\nof Rs.1,30,680/- per acre only after a year.                 In our\n\nconsidered opinion, the view which has been taken in the\n\nimpugned judgment is in consonance with the settled\n\nlegal    position.         The    High   Court   has    taken   into\n\nconsideration        all    the    relevant   facts    in   granting\n\ncompensation.         The High Court was fully justified in\n\ngiving due weightage to the fact that the sale deed of\n\n1986 in respect of this very acquired land was available\n\nand the same ought to be the basis for determining the\n\nmarket value of the land.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">        Learned counsel for the respondent placed reliance\n\non the case of <a href=\"/doc/1534594/\" id=\"a_1\">Bangaru Narasingha Rao Naidu &amp; Ors.\n\nv.

For ascertaining the market rate, the Court\n     can rely upon such transactions which would offer\n     a reasonable basis to fix the price. The price paid in\n     sale or purchase of the land acquired within a\n     reasonable time from the date of the acquisition of\n     the land in question would be the best piece of\n     evidence. In its absence the price paid for a land\n     possessing similar advantages to the land in the\n     neighbourhood of the land acquired in or about the\n     time of the notification would supply the data to\n     assess the market value. But exclusion of bona fide\n     and genuine sale transactions in respect of the\n     same land under acquisition and to place reliance\n     on the award of some other land is obviously illegal.</blockquote><p id=\"p_14\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                                           6</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">     In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1559215/\" id=\"a_3\">Periyar and Pareekanni Rubbers\n\nLtd. v.

In proof of the sale transaction,\n     the relationship of the parties to the transaction,\n     the market conditions, the terms of the sale and the\n     date of the sale are to be looked into. These features\n     would be established by examining either the\n     vendor or vendee and if they are not available, the\n     attesting witnesses who have personal knowledge of\n     the transaction etc. The original sale deed or\n     certified copy thereof should be tendered as\n     evidence. The underlying principle to fix a fair\n     market value with reference to comparable sales is\n     to reduce the element of speculation. In a\n     comparable sale the features are: (1) it must be\n     within a reasonable time of the date of the\n     notification; (2) it should be a bona fide transaction;\n     (3) it should be a sale of the land acquired or land\n     adjacent to the land acquired and (4) it should\n     possess similar advantages. These should be\n     established by adduction of material evidence by\n     examining as stated above the parties to the sale or\n     persons having personal knowledge of the sale\n     transactions.

Relevant\n\nportion of paragraphs 5 and 6 read as under:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">     \"In determining the market value the main criterion\n     is what a willing purchaser would pay a willing\n     vendor. Ordinarily a party will be entitled to get the\n     amount that he actually and willingly paid for a\n     particular property, provided the transaction be\n     bona fide and entered into with due regard to the\n     prevalent market conditions and is proximate in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                                          8</span>\n\n\n     time to the relevant date under Section 23. The\n     best evidence of the value of property is the sale of\n     the very property to which the claimant is a party.\n     If the sale is of a recent date, then all that need\n     normally be proved is that the sale was between a\n     willing purchaser and a willing seller, that there has\n     not been any appreciable rise or fall since and that\n     nothing has been done on the land during the short\n     interval to raise its value. But if the sale was long\n     ago, may be the Court would examine more recent\n     sales of comparable lands as throwing better light\n     on current land value. Such lands should be close\n     by and not a mile-and-half away as one of the\n     examples pressed here was.            So, an actual\n     transaction with respect to the specific land of\n     recent date is a guide-book that courts may not\n     neglect when called upon to pin the precise\n     compensation.\"</blockquote><p id=\"p_22\">\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">     Similarly, in the instant case, only an year ago, the\n\nappellant himself purchased this very piece of land for\n\nRs.45,000/- and after an year, the State has given\n\ncompensation of Rs.1,30,680/-, which cannot be said to\n\nbe inadequate by any stretch of imagination. The\n\nReference Court was not justified in enhancing the\n\namount of compensation to Rs.2,17,800/-. There is no\n\nbasis whatsoever.    In our considered opinion, the view\n\nwhich has been taken by the High Court in the\n\nimpugned judgment is based on settled legal position of\n\nlaw, as indicated in some of the cases noted above.

No separate sentence was imposed.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_4\">2.    Prosecution version as unfolded during trial is as follows:\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">      Jaitubai is the sister of respondent Nos.1 and 2 and niece of\n\nrespondent No.3. Jaitubai was married to Madhukar (hereinafter referred to\n\nas the deceased) long back. Jaitubai had a son Alpesh (PW6) and daughter\n\nHema (PW5). Alpesh and Hema are major. All of them are residents of\n\nRayagaon (Patilfali), Taluka Nawapur, District Nandurbar.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">      Deceased Madhukar brought Ramabai, a married woman and kept her\n\nin his house. On 15.7.2001, first husband of Ramabai, alongwith 15 to 20\n\npersons came to Madhukar. There is a custom prevailing in their\n\ncommunity, which is commonly known as ZAGDA system. As per this\n\ncustom compensation is required to be paid to former husband. Pursuant to\n\nZAGDA system, Madhukar paid Rs.5,051/- to the former husband of\n\nRamabai. Thereafter Madhukar was allowed to marry Ramabai. Jaitubai and\n\nRamabai stayed with Madhukar for a period of 15 days.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                    2</span>\n\f      On account of marriage with Ramabai, the married life of Jaitubai\n\nwas disturbed. Accused nos. 1 to 3 were not happy over this affair. They\n\nwere shocked to know that their brother-in-law Madhukar married Ramabai\n\nand kept her in the house which adversely affected the married life of\n\nJaitubai. Accused became furious and decided to teach a lesson to\n\nMadhukar.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">      The incident occurred on 16.7.2001 at about 6.30 p.m. at a close\n\nproximity of the house of deceased Madhukar. Madhukar gave alarm to the\n\neffect \"MARLE, MARLE\". On hearing the alarm of Madhukar, Reenabai\n\n(PW 3), sister of Madhukar, Gemji (PW 4), brother of Madhukar, daughter\n\nHemabai (PW 5) and son Alpesh (PW 6) immediately arrived on the spot in\n\norder to see what had happened to Madhukar. Surtan (PW 7), Gulabsingh\n\n(PW 8) and other persons from neighbourhood also arrived on the spot after\n\nhaving heard the alarm of Madhukar. Accused Prakash went inside the\n\nhouse and brought two axes. He retained one axe with him and handed over\n\nanother axe to his brother Ramu. Accused no.3 Shiva caught the legs of\n\nMadhukar by means of rope. Accused no.l cut the left hand of Madhukar.\n\nHe also cut right foot of Madhukar. Accused no.2 inflicted axe blows on the\n\nright eye-brow and near the left ear of Madhukar. The blow was given with\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                   3</span>\n\fso much force that the blade of the axe stuck into the head of Madhukar and\n\nhandle of the axe was broken. Accused no.2 brought knife from the house\n\nand inflicted blows on the back of Madhukar by means of knife. Reenabai\n\n(PW 3) tried to rescue her brother Madhukar, however, because of threats\n\nadministered by the accused, she did not dare to rescue her brother\n\nMadhukar. In the presence of dear ones, Madhukar was brutally assaulted.\n\nHis organs were severed by means of axes. But the dear ones and close ones\n\ncould not offer any kind of help to Madhukar. After the brutal assault on\n\nMadhukar, accused nos. 1 to 3 disappeared from the scene of offence.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">      Reenabai (PW3) asked Alpesh (PW6) to go to the Police Patil. Alpesh\n\n(PW6) went to Pangram and contacted Police Patil Shamji Gavit (PW11).\n\nAlpesh (PW-6) narrated the entire incident to him. Police Patil Shamji (PW\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">11) went to Navapur Police Station on the bike belonging to Sarpanch and\n\ndisclosed the occurrence to the Police. Reenabai (PW3) lodged FIR\n\n(Exh.14) at 10.30 p.m. On the basis of FIR (Exh. 14) Crime No. 55/2001\n\ncame to be registered. P.1. Pradip Sonawane (PW18) carried out further\n\ninvestigation of the crime and, after completion of the investigation, sent up\n\nthe charge sheet against the accused nos.1 to 3. Learned Judicial Magistrate,\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                     4</span>\n\fFirst Class, Navapur, District Nandurbar, committed the accused nos.1 to 3\n\nto the Court of Sessions to stand their trial.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">      Since the accused persons pleaded innocence trial was held. As noted\n\nabove, the trial Court found the accused persons guilty and death sentence\n\nin respect of A-1 and A-2 and life imprisonment to A-3 was awarded. Three\n\nwitnesses were stated to have witnessed the occurrence. They are PWs 3, 4\n\nand 6. The trial Court found their evidence to be adequate and accordingly\n\nrecorded the conviction and imposed sentences. The High Court directed\n\nacquittal primarily on the ground that PW-3 did not speak about the\n\npresence of Gemji (PW-4) and there is doubt about the place of recording\n\nthe first information report and delay in lodging it. PW-3 did not speak\n\nabout the assault by A-2 with knife. Only PW-6 spoke about it. No overt act\n\nwas attributed by PW-6 to A-3. PW-4 did not say that the axe was fixed on\n\nthe head. The evidence of PW-2 was full of contradictions as there was\n\ndiscrepancy about the recovery.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">3.    Learned counsel for the appellant-State submitted that the High Court\n\nhas lost sight of several important factors and attached undue importance to\n\nminor discrepancies which are normal.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                       5</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">\f4.    Learned counsel for the respondents on the other hand supported the\n\njudgment of the High Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">5.    It is to be noted that PW-3 is the sister of the deceased. There was\n\npractically no cross examination on the assault part. So far as fixing of the\n\naxe on the head is concerned, unnecessary importance appear to have been\n\nattached to the same. As a matter of fact the conclusion of the High Court is\n\nerroneous because PW-4 in his evidence has categorically stated that the\n\ndeceased was having injury on his body due to assault by means of axes.\n\nOne axe was found inserted in the bone of head near the left ear. The handle\n\nof that axe was in a broken condition. According to the evidence the axe\n\nwas inserted near about 4 to 5 inches in the head. Thereafter, all the three\n\naccused persons ran way from the spot. The motive indicated was that the\n\ndeceased was having a illicit relationship with another lady and, therefore,\n\nthe family members of the wife were upset. The High Court has come to an\n\nabsurd conclusion that the eye witnesses PWs 3 and 6 gave account of 4 to 5\n\nexternal injuries but the witnesses did not utter a single word about\n\nremaining 15 injuries. The High Court came to the conclusion that if at all\n\nthese two witnesses witnessed the incident from a short distance then it was\n\nnot explained as to why they were not able to account for the remaining\n\ninjuries which were found on the body of the deceased. A witness who\n\nwitnesses an attack on another by three persons armed is not supposed to go\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                    6</span>\n\fon counting number of assaults on the parts of the body where the injuries\n\nwere inflicted. They had categorically stated about the external injuries 1, 4,\n\n8, 14 and 18. It is noticed that PWs 3 and 4 came running after hearing\n\nshout of the deceased. So it was possible that they had not noticed the\n\ninjuries which were earlier sustained due to assaults. They appeared at the\n\nspot when the assault was continuing. As a matter of fact, in his cross\n\nexamination PW-4 had stated that on hearing shout of the deceased he\n\nrushed towards him and reached there within a short time. When he reached\n\nat the spot of incident, at that time the deceased was lying on the ground\n\nhaving injuries on his person. As noted above, there is practically no cross\n\nexamination of any of the eye witnesses i.e. PWs 3, 4 and 6 on the assault\n\npart.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_17\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">6.      So far as the delay in lodging the First Information Report is\n\nconcerned, it has been accepted that the informant went to the wrong police\n\nstation and when he was directed to go to Navapur Police Station, he went\n\nthere and lodged the FIR. That clearly explains the delay. In the ultimate\n\nanalysis, High Court was not justified in directing acquittal of A1 and A2.\n\nHowever, so far as A-3 is concerned, the High Court has indicated sufficient\n\nreasons for holding him not guilty. Same needs no interference. But the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                     7</span>\n\freasons indicated for directing acquittal of A-1 and A-2 are not justified.\n\nWe, therefore, set aside the judgment of High Court so far as their acquittal\n\nis concerned. But considering the facts of the case, it is apparent that the\n\naccused persons were annoyed with the deceased because of his having\n\nillicit relationship with another lady while his wife was alive. The case does\n\nnot fall to the rarest of rare category. The appropriate sentence would be\n\nlife imprisonment. The State's appeal is allowed to the extent indicated\n\nabove. Respondents 1 and 2 are directed to surrender to custody forthwith to\n\nserve the remainder of sentence.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_19\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">                                ..........................................J.\n                                (Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT)\n\n\n                                ..........................................J.\n                                (Dr. MUKUNDAKAM SHARMA)\nNew Delhi,\nJanuary 21, 2009\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                     8</span>\n\f</p>","tid":882689,"showurl":true,"citeList":[{"tid":37788,"url":null,"title":"Section 34 in The Indian Penal Code"},{"tid":180217,"url":null,"title":"Section 506 in The Indian Penal Code"},{"tid":1569253,"url":null,"title":"The Indian Penal Code"}]}, {"numcites":5,"covertids":[],"covertitles":[],"relatedqs":[{"value":"narcotics","formInput":"narcotics"},{"value":"opium","formInput":"opium"}],"firstname":null,"title":"Abbas Khan vs Central Bureau Of Narcotics on 14 January, 2009","url":"http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgst.aspx?filename=33518","lastname":"...............","secondname":null,"publishdate":"2009-01-14","citedbyList":[{"tid":19424181,"url":"http://lobis.nic.in/dhc/SMD/judgement/02-06-2009/SMD29052009BA6732009.pdf","title":"Amarjeet Singh vs D.R.I. on 29 May, 2009"},{"tid":75074028,"url":null,"title":"Ncb vs .

The prosecution case was that the\n\nSuperintendent-M.C.Vijay of the Central Bureau of Narcotics, along with\n\nother officers, were on patrol duty on 1.5.1997 and at about 9.45 p.m. they\n\nintercepted the truck-DIG 4753. Two persons were in the truck and when\n\nthey stopped the truck and thereafter started running away and the\n\nInspector A.K.Tulsidasan apprehended them. The truck was searched in the\n\npresence of the witnesses and it was found that 2.10 KGs of Opium and 8\n\nKGs of Dodachura were also found in the truck.        The officers prepared a\n\nmazhar and seized the articles and a case was registered against two accused\n\nviz. Shri Hardeo Singh and Daljeet Singh. On questioning these two accused,\n\nofficers came to   know   that   Opium was sold by the present appellants\n\nAbbas\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                     2</span>\n\nKhan and Azam Khan. P.W.6 issued a notice under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 67</a> of the Act to\n\nthe appellants and their statements were taken.     In their statements they\n\nadmitted having sold Opium to other accused who were also travelling in the\n\ntruck.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_2\">            After the trial the Special Judge found all the four guilty under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/325366/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 18</a> of the Act and they were sentenced to undergo 10 years rigorous\n\nimprisonment with a fine of Rs.1 lac each.      In the appeal filed by the\n\naccused, the High Court confirmed the conviction.      The first and second\n\naccused Hardeo Singh and Daljeet Singh did not prefer any appeal while\n\naccused nos.3 and 4 have filed the present appeals before this Court.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_3\">            Heard both sides.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">            The prosecution relied on the admission made under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 67</a>\n\nof the Act by these two accused before P.W.6 but we notice that the\n\ncontraband articles allegedly seized from the first and second accused were\n\nnot shown to the present two appellants and there is no evidence to show\n\nthat the very same articles were seized by the officers in the course of\n\ninvestigation. There is practically no evidence to show as to how much\n\nquantity of articles were allegedly sold by these appellants. However, we do\n\nnot think that the statements made by these accused are inadmissible in\n\nevidence as they were made under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 67</a> of the Act. At the same time\n\nthe evidence adduced would only prove that they had dealt with narcotic\n\ndrugs and to that extent the admission is valid. As the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                      3</span>\n\nquantity itself is not proved, one could only say that it is not possible to\n\nassume that they were dealing with any commercial quantity of contraband\n\narticles, which offence by itself is of a very serious nature. The prosecution\n\nshould have produced better evidence to sustain such conviction.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">            Under the above circumstances, we hold that the accused could\n\nonly be convicted under <a href=\"/doc/30948923/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 18(b)</a> of the Act.       We are told that the\n\nappellants have already undergone a fairly long period of sentence. There is\n\nno evidence that they were dealing with any commercial quantity of these\n\ncontraband articles. Therefore, we confirm the conviction. In our opinion,\n\nthe sentence already undergone by the appellants is sufficient to meet the\n\nends of justice.   We direct the appellants to be released forthwith, if not\n\nrequired in any other case. Learned counsel for the appellants submits that\n\nthe fine imposed is also not paid so far.    The fine so imposed upon the\n\nappellants is also waived off.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">            The appeals are disposed of accordingly.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">                                                                ...............CJI.\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">                                                        (K.G.

Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the\n\nBombay High Court dismissing the appeal filed by the appellant. Learned\n\n2nd Additional Sessions Judge, Sangli, had convicted the appellant for\n\noffence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 302</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                          1</span>\n\fshort the `<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a>') and sentenced to undergo life imprisonment and to pay a\n\nfine of Rs.1,000/- with default stipulation.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">3.    Prosecution version in a nutshell is as follows:\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">      The accused-appellant and one Shivaji Baba Lohar who was working\n\nwith Keru (hereinafter referred to as the `deceased') were on inimical terms.\n\nShivaji's sister was married to the accused. The accused had borrowed\n\nmoney from Shivaji which he had not returned. The accused used to visit\n\nShivaji in the field owned by the deceased. Keru and his family knew the\n\naccused and would often give him agricultural produce from their lands\n\nsince the accused was jobless. Shivaji demanded repayment of the loan he\n\nhad advanced to the accused. The accused was annoyed by this and on\n\n3.6.2000 he went to Keru's farm. Keru was asleep at a little distance from\n\nthe rest of the members of his family. Shivaji was sleeping at another spot\n\non the farm, a little further away from the family. The accused entered the\n\nfarm before daybreak, at about 3 am. The dogs started barking and Maruti,\n\nthe son of the deceased saw the accused beating the victim with a yoke.\n\nMaruti alerted Shivaji and they chased the accused, but he managed to\n\nescape their clutches. Maruti and Shivaji returned to the spot where the\n\nvictim was lying. They found that his skull had been fractured and a part of\n\nhis brain was protruding. Three fingers of his right hand were fractured and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                         2</span>\n\fbroken. His head and ears were bleeding. Maruti lodged a complaint with\n\nthe police. The dead body of Keru was taken for the autopsy. The required\n\npanchanamas were drawn up and statements of witnesses were recorded.\n\nThe accused was apprehended and charged for having committed an offence\n\npunishable under section, 302 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_3\">IPC</a>. His trial was committed to Sessions. The\n\nSessions Court after consideration of the evidence on record as noted above\n\nconvicted the accused.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">         Before the High Court the only stand was that the evidence of the so\n\ncalled eye witnesses PWs 1 and 4 cannot be relied upon. It was also\n\nsubmitted that a case under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 302</a> IPC was not made out. The High\n\nCourt found no substance in the plea and dismissed the appeal as afore-\n\nnoted.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">4.       The stand taken before the High Court was re-iterated in the present\n\nappeal.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">5.       The evidence of PWs 1 and 4 does not suffer from any infirmity. PW-\n\n1 has categorically stated that he was awakened by the barking of dogs. He\n\nheard the sound of somebody being beaten. He saw the incident in the light\n\nfrom a lantern when the accused was hitting his father on the head with a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                         3</span>\n\fyoke. The witness claimed to have chased the accused but could not catch\n\nhim. The evidence of PW-4, the widow was to the similar effect. Both the\n\ntrial Court and the High Court have referred to the evidence in great detail\n\nand found that their evidence is credible and cogent and unerringly points at\n\nthe accused to be author of the crime. The other question is regarding\n\napplicability of <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 302</a> IPC. It appears that the accused and the\n\ndeceased were in inimical terms. Only one blow was given with the yoke in\n\nthe night. PW-4 has categorically admitted that it was dark, but he identified\n\nthe accused because he was known to him. Number of injuries is always not\n\na determinative factor regarding applicability of <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 302</a> IPC. The\n\nnature of the weapon, place where it was struck and several other relevant\n\nfactors throw light on this aspect. Considering the background facts of the\n\npresent case according to us the appropriate conviction would be under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 304</a> Part I IPC. Custodial sentence of 10 years would meet the ends\n\nof justice.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">6.

Similarly, assessee contends that\n\nthere a conceptual difference between current depreciation and carried forward\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                           2</span>\n\funabsorbed depreciation. It is the case of the assessee that Explanation (a) to Section\n\n158BB does not rule out current year's losses or current year's depreciation; it only\n\nrules out the brought forward losses or unabsorbed depreciation under Section 32(2).\n\nAccording to the appellant, this difference is lost sight of by the Settlement\n\nCommission in its impugned judgment.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">         In order to answer the contention raised on behalf of the assessee, one has\n\nto examine the scheme of Section 158BB of the 1961 Act. It is not in controversy that\n\nChapter XIV-B constitutes a Code by itself.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">         In this case, we are concerned with the computation of \"undisclosed\n\nincome\" under Section 158BB of the Act. Section 158BB, inter alia, states that\n\nundisclosed income of the block period shall be \"the aggregate of the total income of\n\nthe previous years falling within the block period\" computed in accordance with the\n\nprovisions of Chapter IV. \"Total income\" is defined in Section 2(45) to mean the\n\ntotal amount of income referred to in section 5, computed in the manner laid down in\n\nthe Act. In other words, Chapter XIV does not rule out Chapter IV of the Act in the\n\nmatter of computation of undisclosed income under Chapter XIV-B. It may be\n\nmentioned that ordinarily, in the case of regular assessment, the unit of assessment is\n\none year consisting of twelve months whereas in the case of block assessment, the unit\n\nof assessment consists of ten previous years and the period upto the date of the\n\nsearch. Section 158BB provides for aggregation of income/loss of each previous year\n\ncomprised in the block period. The block period assessment under Chapter XIV-B is\n\nin addition to regular assessment.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">         Analysing Section 158BB(4) read with Explanation (a) thereto, one finds\n\nthat only brought forward losses of the past years under Chapter VI and unabsorbed\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                           3</span>\n\fdepreciation under Section 32(2) are to be excluded while aggregating the total\n\nincome or loss of each previous year in the block period but set off of the loss suffered\n\nin any of the previous year in the block period against the income assessed in other\n\nprevious years in the block period is not prohibited. In our view, the Settlement\n\nCommission had erred in disallowing the application of the assessee for set off of\n\ninter se losses and depreciation accruing in any of the previous year in the block\n\nperiod against the income returned/assessed in any other previous year in the block\n\nperiod.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">          For the aforestated reasons, we set aside the impugned judgment of the\n\nHigh Court as well as the decision of the Settlement Commission and we remit the\n\nmatter to the Settlement Commission for fresh computation of the undisclosed income\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1971671/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 158BB</a> of the Income Tax Act, 1961 for the block period in question.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">          Civil Appeals are allowed accordingly, with no order as to costs.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">                                    ...................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">                                                       (S.H.

Learned\n\ncounsel has pointed out that during the pendency of these appeals, the respondent had\n\nmoved an application for grant of regular bail before the trial Court. However, the\n\nsaid application was opposed by the complainant, inter alia, on the ground that the\n\norder granting anticipatory bail to the respondent had been challenged before this\n\nCourt and the special leave petitions were pending. Taking note of the said fact, the\n\ntrial Court has declined to entertain the application filed by the respondent for grant of\n\nbail. A copy of order dated October 17, 2008, has been placed on record.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">            Bearing in mind the fact that the charge-sheet has already been filed against\n\nthe respondent and the trial Court is seized of the matter, we feel that it would be\n\nappropriate if the respondent is permitted to file a fresh application before the trial\n\nCourt for grant of regular bail.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">                                                                                      ..3/-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">\n\n\nCrl.As. 90 &amp; 91/2009....contd...\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                           :3:</span>\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">            Accordingly, we dispose of the appeals with liberty to the respondent to\n\napply for regular bail before the trial Court within two weeks from the receipt of the\n\fcopy of this order. As and when such an application is preferred, the same shall be\n\nconsidered on its own merits, uninfluenced by order dated December 27, 2007, passed\n\nby the High Court, granting anticipatory bail to the said respondent. We further direct\n\nthat the order passed by the High Court, impugned in these appeals, shall remain in\n\nforce till respondent's application for grant of regular bail is disposed of. The trial\n\nCourt would do will to dispose of the bail application expeditiously, preferably within\n\nfour weeks of its presentation.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">                                  ....................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">                                                      [ D.K.

It was their case\n\n  that one M.Amarender Reddy (hereinafter referred to as `deceased') was traveling\n\n  in a bus owned by the Corporation. The driver of the bus, who was driving the\n\n  vehicle in a rash and negligent manner, suddenly applied the brakes as a result of\n\n  which the deceased was thrown out of the bus and was injured and ultimately\n\n  succumbed.

It is to be noted that the MACT had worked out\n\nthe loss of dependency at Rs.1,500/- by deducting 50% of the monthly income.

This appeal arises from the order passed by the Division Bench of the\n\nCalcutta High Court allowing the writ appeal filed by the respondent No.1.\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">\f4.    The facts, as presented by the appellants, are as follows:\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">      Respondent No.1 was appointed to the post of Superintendent of\n\nChhoto Jagulia Junior Technical School, presently named as Industrial\n\nTraining Centre Chhoto Jagulia, by the Governing Body of the said Institute\n\non 7.7.1993. He was also given the responsibility of the Ex-officio Secretary\n\nof the Governing Body.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">      Due to some allegations against Respondent No.1, namely, non-\n\nfunctioning of the administrative work as well the non-attending the\n\nInstitution an Enquiry Committee was set up. On the basis of the decision\n\nof the Committee, administrative function as a Member Secretary was\n\nwithdrawn and another person was appointed.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">      A writ petition was filed by respondent No.1 taking the stand that he\n\nshould be allowed to continue as Superintendent. His stand was that he was\n\nprevented from discharging duties after 10.3.1997. Originally, the petition\n\nwas filed before the West Bengal Administrative Tribunal (in short `the\n\nTribunal') and interim order was passed by the Tribunal directing that there\n\nshould be so interference with the functioning of the present respondent\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                     2</span>\n\fNo.1. Alleging that the interim order was not being carried out contempt\n\npetition was filed. Tribunal disposed of the petition with certain directions.\n\nSubsequently, on 30.3.1998 the Original Application was dismissed on the\n\nground that Tribunal had no jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">      On 11.5.1998, a writ petition was filed in the Calcutta High Court\n\nseeking restoration of status as Member Secretary of the Governing Body.\n\nCertain interim directions were given. The present appellant took the stand\n\nthat the respondent was not attending the office and was not signing the\n\nattendance register. A special leave petition was filed by respondent No.1\n\nbefore this Court which was withdrawn. The same was directed against the\n\norder dated 22.9.2000 in CPAN 768/2000. The writ petition was dismissed\n\nby learned Single Judge on several counts. The basic conclusion was that\n\nsince factual dispute was involved the writ petition was not to be\n\nentertained.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">      A writ appeal was filed before the High Court and contempt\n\nproceedings were also initiated. The Division Bench directed that lawful\n\narrears have to be paid. Certain directions were given making stringent\n\nobservations against the officials. An amount of Rs.7,33,567/- was paid.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                      3</span>\n\fThe High Court was primarily of the view that since the proceedings for\n\nabsence were not initiated, the appellant should be bound to pay and there\n\nwas no question of any prejudice involved. The writ appeal was allowed in\n\nthe aforesaid terms.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_18\">5.    Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the writ petition was\n\ndismissed on the ground that factual controversy is involved, i.e. whether\n\nthe writ petitioner's stand that he was prevented from attending duties or\n\nwhether the appellant's stand that he was not attending office is correct. It\n\nrequires factual adjudication and such question cannot be decided in the\n\nwrit petition. It is also pointed out that without condoning the delay several\n\ninterim orders were passed which is not permissible in law.            Learned\n\ncounsel for the respondent No.1, on the other hand, submitted that\n\nvoluminous documents are available to show that the writ petitioner was\n\nprevented from attending their duties and carrying on his functions.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">6.    It is to be noticed that even without condoning the delay and\n\nentertaining the writ appeal the High Court has passed series of interim\n\norders. Such a course is impermissible as the appeal was non-est in the eye\n\nof law without it being entertained. Admittedly, the delay in preferring the\n\nwrit appeal was not condoned at the time when the interim orders were\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                       4</span>\n\fpassed. The High Court has committed another error in holding that the\n\nwrit petition was dismissed principally on the ground that it was the\n\ndecision of the Governing Body as to who should be its Secretary, although\n\nGovernment approval is necessary for appointment of the Secretary of the\n\nGoverning Body of the Institute. On the contrary the learned Single Judge\n\ndismissed the writ petition principally on the ground that factual\n\ncontroversy is involved. The Division Bench has not discussed this aspect\n\nat all. Therefore, the order is clearly indefensible.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">7.    In the aforesaid background, we set aside the impugned judgment of\n\nthe High Court and remit the matter for its consideration as to whether the\n\nwrit appeal was to be entertained in view of the conclusions of the learned\n\nSingle Judge that factual controversies are involved and, therefore, the writ\n\npetition was not maintainable.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_21\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">8.    The appeal is allowed without any order as to costs.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">                                        .................................................J.\n                                        (Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT)\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                                      5</span>\n\f                                           ...................\n</p><p id=\"p_24\">      ............................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_25\">                                       (ASOK KUMAR GANGULY)\nNew Delhi,\nJanuary 23, 2009\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                 6</span>\n\f</p>","tid":1782579,"showurl":true,"citeList":[]}, {"numcites":0,"covertids":[],"covertitles":[],"relatedqs":[{"value":"civil appeal","formInput":"civil%20appeal"},{"value":" s h kapadia","formInput":"%20s%20h%20kapadia"},{"value":"aftab alam","formInput":"aftab%20alam"}],"firstname":null,"title":"Union Of India & Ors vs P.N.Singh & Ors on 23 January, 2009","url":"http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgst.aspx?filename=33572","lastname":"....................j.","secondname":null,"publishdate":"2009-01-23","citedbyList":[{"tid":1082042,"url":null,"title":"State Of Kerala And Anr. vs V.M.

In 2006, he was informed by the             Excise authorities that his\n\napplication could not be considered and granted as per the then existing law. Feeling\n\naggrieved, the appellant approached the High Court by filing a writ petition. Learned\n\nsingle Judge disposed of the writ petition by order dated 6.12.2006 with a direction to\n\nthe Excise Commissioner to consider the eligibility of the respondent with reference to\n\nthe qualifications required as on the date of the application. That was challenged by the\n\nState by filing a writ appeal. The writ appeal was dismissed by the Division Bench on\n\nthe ground of delay. The said order is challenged in this appeal by special leave.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_2\">2.         On examining the reasons assigned by the appellant State for condonation of\n\ndelay in filing the appeal before the High Court, we are of the view that the delay ought\n\nto have been condoned by the High Court. The appellant should have an opportunity to\n\nchallenge the order of the learned single Judge on merits as there is an important\n\nquestion relating to applicability of the relevant rules.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_3\">                                                                                      .....2.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                               -2-</span><p id=\"p_4\">\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">3.

We are informed that after the dismissal of the appeal by the High Court, the\n\nState has granted temporary licence to the respondent in December as there was no stay\n\nin this appeal.

Dr. Karanth expired on 9.12.1997.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">Yakshagana Ballet dance as developed by Dr. Karanth was performed in\n\nNew Delhi on or about 18.9.2001. Respondent filed a suit for declaration,\n\ninjunction and damages alleging violation of the copyright in respect of the\n\nsaid dance vested in her in terms of the said Will stating that Dr. Karanth\n\ndeveloped a new distinctive dance, drama troop or theatrical system which\n\nwas named by him as `Yaksha Ranga' which in his own words mean\n\n\"creative extension of traditional Yakshagana\" and, thus, the appellants\n\ninfringed the copyright thereof by performing the same at New Delhi\n\nwithout obtaining her prior permission. It was stated that Dr. Karanth had\n\ncomposed seven verses or prasangas for staging Yaksharanga Ballet apart\n\nfrom bringing in changes in the traditional form thereof on its relevant\n\naspects, namely, Raga, Tala, Scenic arrangement, Costumes etc. These\n\nprasangas are: (i) Bhishma Vijaya; (ii) Nala Damayanthi; (iii) Kanakangi or\n\nKanakangi Kalyana; (iv) Abhimanyu or Abhimanyu Vada; (v) Chitrangadha\n\nor Babruvahana Kalaga; (vi) Panchavati; and (vii) Ganga Charitha.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_6\">3.

Since I left the house `suhasa' I have been\nliving in a specially built house \"Manasa\" of Smt.\nMalini Mallya, who has built it with borrowed\nmoney at her cost. She had joined my service as\nCopyist and later, she secured an employment in\nLife Insurance Corporation of India. Ever since\n1974 till now in my old age she has been serving\nme with exemplary devotion and sincerity. And in\nthis occasion I must also acknowledge with\ngratitude that she diligently cared and nursed my\nwife Leela Karanth during her prolonged illness\ntill her last day. And she has cared and looked\nafter me also during my illness which at times had\nbeen quite serious, enfeebling me for long period.\nIn recognition of her devotion and sincere\naffection towards me in 1986 I have dedicated one\nof my novels namely, \"Antida Aparanji\" to her. I\nhave also placed on record her invaluable services\nto me in my Memoirs, \"Hunchu Mansina Hathu\nMukhagalu\" 1991 Edition. In my opinion, very\nlong enduring and a signal service she has done to\nme and to my literary works is, in writing a\nbibliography of all my books- a highly meritorious\nand scholarly work involving so much of pains\ntaking research, that it has been acclaimed and\nrated as the first of its kind in Kannada and highly\nappreciated by Critics and Scholars. Apart from\nthis, she has collected and edited all my stray\nwritings from 1924 onwards upto date in eight\nSumptuous volumes which are being published by\nMangalore University.          This work also has\nbrought her deserving fame and appreciation of\nScholars.      Such painstaking service in this\ndirection has brought to light several of my\nhitherto untraced, forgotten and unknown writings\nand thereby giving them extended or renewed\nlease of life. For all these services, I hereby\ndeclare that after my death copyrights in respect of\nall my literary works shall vest with Smt. Malini\nMallya and she alone shall be entitled to receive\nroyalties of all my books and she shall be entitled\nto print, publish and republish and market the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                    4</span>\n\n             same.

And I have\n             distributed all copper and bronze vessels and\n             utensils among my children while leaving my\n             former home \"Suhasa\" keeping only bare essential\n             and necessary things and articles. Whatever\n             movable properties, books, fittings, furniture,\n             utensils etc. belonging to me into this house\n             `Manasa' and my Car and cash money in hand\n             after my death shall go to Smt.

Any outstanding due to me and Bank\n             Deposits and whatever assets or properties not\n             mentioned above, that is, residuary after my death\n             shall belong to Smt.

Appellants in their written statement, however, denied and disputed\n\nany copyright of the said dance in Dr. Karanth alleging that whatever work\n\nhe had done was in the capacity of a Director of the Kendra with the\n\nassistance, finance and staff provided by the Organization of Mahatma\n\nGandhi Memorial College Trust in respect whereof a Committee was\n\nformed under him by the Board of Trustees.

Appellants aggrieved thereby and dissatisfied therewith preferred an\n\nappeal before the Karnataka High Court which was marked as R.F.A. No.\n\n271 of 2004.     By reason of the impugned judgment and order dated\n\n5.12.2007, the said appeal has been dismissed.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_13\">8.    Appellants are, thus, before us.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_14\">9.

P-1. I have\n             already referred to para No. 11 of the `Will'\n             while dealing with the topic dramatic works vis-\n             `-vis literary work and therefore if the `Will' is\n             read in its entirety and if we take into account,\n             the benefits that flow from the bequest made by\n             Dr. Karanth in favour of the plaintiff, it is not as\n             if the plaintiff received the bequest only in\n             respect of the things which form the residuary as\n             mentioned in para-12 of the `Will' but the\n             plaintiff also was given the copyrights in respect\n             of literary works and all books as well as the\n             right to print, republished and mark the literary\n             works as well as the books.\"</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p_43\">      Referring to the new Encyclopaedia Britannica and Halsbury's Laws\n\nof England, that a literary work with dramatic elements in it would also be\n\nliterary work, the High Court observed:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">             \"Dramatic works also could contain in its,\n             passages of great literary taste, as in the case of\n             great plays of William Shakespear. Therefore, the\n             main classification as literary work and dramatic\n             work cannot be construed to mean that dramatic\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">\f                                    16</span>\n\n            work has nothing to do with literary work. The\n            only difference I see in them is that the dramatic\n            work (Plays) forms the text upon which the\n            performance of the plays rests whereas a `literary\n            work' enables one to read the printed words.\n            Neither of the two can be produced without the\n            imaginative skill of the author.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">      It was furthermore held:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">            \"I am of the considered opinion that all the above\n            changes brought about by Dr. Karanth in respect\n            of Yakshagana Ballet leads to the inference that\n            the imaginative faculties of Dr. Karanth permeated\n            the entire Yakshagana Prasangas and thus a new\n            look was given to the Yakshagana Ballets. I,\n            therefore, hold that the bequest of copyright in\n            literary works and books in favour of the plaintiff\n            by Dr. Karanth, will have to be treated as the\n            bequest covering the dramatic works also since I\n            have also drawn the conclusion that the dramatic\n            works is also a form of literature. Therefore,\n            necessity of mentioning copyright separately in\n            respect of dramatic works does not arise. The\n            plaintiff, therefore, is entitled to copyright even in\n            respect of the dramatic works namely the seven\n            prasangas, by virtue of bequest made in her favour\n            in respect of copyrights and books.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">14.   Broadly speaking, a dramatic work may also come within the purview\n\nof literary work being a part of dramatic literature. The new Encyclopaedia\n\nBritannica (Vol-IV) 15th Edition, provides the following information about\n\n\"Dramatic Literature.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">\f                                      17</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">         \"Dramatic Literature: the texts of plays that can be read, as distinct\n         from being seen and heard in performance.\"</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">         We must, however, notice that the provisions the Act make a\n\ndistinction between the `literary work' and `dramatic work'. Keeping in\n\nview the statutory provisions, there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that\n\ncopyright in respect of performance of `dance' would not come within the\n\npurview of the literary work but would come within the purview of the\n\ndefinition of `dramatic work'. We, however, do not mean to suggest that any\n\nact of literary work will be outside the purview of the Will dated 18.6.1994.\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"p_44\">Our exercise in this behalf was only for the purpose of clarifying the\n\nprovisions of the Act with reference to the findings arrived at by the High\n\nCourt.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_45\">15.      For the aforementioned reasons, we agree with Dr. Dhavan that\n\nparagraph 12 of the Will, namely, residuary clause shall apply in the instant\n\ncase apart from the areas which are otherwise covered by paragraph 11 of\n\nthe Will. The residuary clause will apply because it is well settled that no\n\npart of the stay lies in limbo. It was also not a case where respondent in any\n\nmanner whatsoever waived her right.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">\f                                    18</span>\n\n<p id=\"p_46\">16.   The learned trial judge on issue No. 4 opined that plaintiff had not\n\nbeen able to prove actual loss or damage particularly having regard to the\n\nfact that Dr. Karanth had associated himself with the appellants for a long\n\ntime. The learned trial judge recognized the equitable interest vested in the\n\nplaintiff - respondent. A declaratory decree, therefore, was passed.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_47\">17.   We may notice at this stage that the form of injunction granted both\n\nby the learned trial judge as also by the High Court in favour of the\n\nplaintiff-respondent.

Where the same idea is being developed in a\n                    different manner, it is manifest that the\n                    source being common, similarities are\n                    bound to occur. In such a case the courts\n                    should determine whether or not the\n                    similarities are on fundamental or\n                    substantial aspects of the mode of\n                    expression adopted in the copyrighted work.\n                    If the defendant's work is nothing but a\n                    literal imitation of the copyrighted work\n                    with some variations here and there it would\n                    amount to violation of the copyright. In\n                    other words, in order to be actionable the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">\f                      20</span>\n\n     copy must be a substantial and material one\n     which at once leads to the conclusion that\n     the defendant is guilty of an act of piracy.\n</blockquote><p id=\"p_50\">3.   One of the surest and the safest test to\n     determine whether or not there has been a\n     violation of copyright is to see if the reader,\n     spectator or the viewer after having read or\n     seen both the works is clearly of the opinion\n     and gets an unmistakable impression that\n     the subsequent work appears to be a copy of\n     the original.\n</p><p id=\"p_51\">4.   Where the theme is the same but is\n     presented and treated differently so that the\n     subsequent work becomes a completely new\n     work, no question of violation of copyright\n     arises.\n</p><p id=\"p_52\">5.   Where however apart from the similarities\n     appearing in the two works there are also\n     material and broad dissimilarities which\n     negative the intention to copy the original\n     and the coincidences appearing in the two\n     works are clearly incidental no infringement\n     of the copyright comes into existence.\n</p><p id=\"p_53\">6.   As a violation of copyright amounts to an\n     act of piracy it must be proved by clear and\n     cogent evidence after applying the various\n     tests laid down by the case-law discussed\n     above.\n</p><p id=\"p_54\">7.   Where however the question is of the\n     violation of the copyright of stage play by a\n     film producer or a director the task of the\n     plaintiff becomes more difficult to prove\n     piracy. It is manifest that unlike a stage play\n     a film has a much broader prospective,\n     wider field and a bigger background where\n     the defendants can by introducing a variety\n     of incidents give a colour and complexion\n     different from the manner in which the\n     copyrighted work has expressed the idea.\n     Even so, if the viewer after seeing the film\n     gets a totality of impression that the film is\n     by and large a copy of the original play,\n     violation of the copyright may be said to be\n     proved.\"\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">\f                                     21</span>\n\n<p id=\"p_55\">      Yet again in <a href=\"/doc/1062099/\" id=\"a_19\">Eastern Book Company &amp; ors. vs. D.B.

Copyrighted material is that what is\n             created by the author by his own skill, labour and\n             investment of capital, maybe it is a derivative\n             work which gives a flavour of creativity. The\n             copyright work which comes into being should be\n             original in the sense that by virtue of selection,\n             coordination or arrangement of pre-existing data\n             contained in the work, a work somewhat different\n             in character is produced by the author. On the face\n             of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_21\">Copyright Act</a>, 1957, we\n             think that the principle laid down by the Canadian\n             Court would be applicable in copyright of the\n             judgments of the Apex Court. We make it clear\n             that the decision of ours would be confined to the\n             judgments of the courts which are in the public\n             domain as by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/1013176/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 52</a> of the Act there\n             is no copyright in the original text of the\n             judgments. To claim copyright in a compilation,\n             the author must produce the material with exercise\n             of his skill and judgment which may not be\n             creativity in the sense that it is novel or non-\n             obvious, but at the same time it is not a product of\n             merely labour and capital. The derivative work\n             produced by the author must have some\n             distinguishable features and flavour to raw text of\n             the judgments delivered by the court. The trivial\n             variation or inputs put in the judgment would not\n             satisfy the test of copyright of an author.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p_57\">20.   The High Court, in our opinion, should have clarified that the\n\nappellants can also take the statutory benefit of the provisions contained in\n\nclauses (a), (i) and (l) of sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1013176/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 52</a> of the Act.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">\f                                       22</span>\n\n<p id=\"p_58\">      <a href=\"/doc/1013176/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 52</a> of the Act provides for certain acts which would not\n\nconstitute an infringement of copyright. When a fair dealing is made, inter\n\nalia, of a literary or dramatic work for the purpose of private use including\n\nresearch and criticism or review, whether of that work or of any other work,\n\nthe right in terms of the provisions of the said Act cannot be claimed. Thus,\n\nif some performance or dance is carried out within the purview of the said\n\nclause, the order of injunction shall not be applicable. Similarly, appellant\n\nbeing an educational institution, if the dance is performed within the\n\nmeaning of provisions of clause (i) of sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1013176/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 52</a> of the\n\nAct strictly, the order of injunction shall not apply thereto also. Yet again,\n\nif such performance is conducted before a non-paying audience by the\n\nappellant, which is an institution if it comes within the purview of amateur\n\nclub or society, the same would not constitute any violation of the said order\n\nof injunction.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_59\">21.   With the aforementioned modification in the order of injunction, this\n\nappeal is dismissed.

The deceased Balma @ Balram Gond,\n\nRamgopal and Shankarlal admittedly were travelling in the said vehicle.\n</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_4\">3.    A First Information Report was lodged.         The heirs and legal\n\nrepresentatives of the deceased filed applications for grant of compensation\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                        2</span>\n\n\nin terms of <a href=\"/doc/136948773/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 166</a> of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (for short \"the\n\nAct\") which was marked as Claim Case Nos. 76, 78 and 79 of 2002.\n</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_5\">4.    The learned Tribunal, having regard to the rival contentions of the\n\nparties, framed the following issues:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">             \"1. Whether on 21.11.99 in the night at about 8\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">             a.m. near village Semri, non applicant No. 1</span>\n             driving Jeep No. MP04 1824 and truck No.\n             MP04K2028 driven negligently and rashly the\n             collision between the two vehicle occurred and in\n             the result Shankarlal died.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">             2.     Whether there was contributory negligence\n             on the part of both the drivers? If so, effect.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">             3.     At 8 p.m. Jeep No. MP04J1824 was dashed\n             by truck No. MP04 K 2028 and the accident was\n             caused, if so, effect..\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">             4.

The learned Tribunal upon consideration of the depositions of the\n\nwitnesses held that neither the truck No. MP04K 2028 was involved in the\n\naccident, nor was it caused on account of rash and negligent driving on the\n\npart of its driver. The learned Tribunal passed awards in all the three cases\n\nas under:\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                    3</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      Claim Case No. 76 of 2002             Rs. 1,32,000/-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">      Claim Case No. 78 of 2002             Rs. 1,92,000/-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">      Claim Case No. 79 of 2002             Rs. 4,22,400/-\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_7\">6.    Appeals were preferred thereagainst by the appellant. By reason of\n\nthe impugned judgment, the High Court, however, reversed the said\n\nfindings, holding:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">            \"16. Coming to question of negligence, though\n            Mohan Singh and two other witnesses examined\n            by the claimant has stated that it was the truck\n            driver who drove it in rash and negligent manner.\n            However, in the claim petition, it was rightly\n            mentioned that jeep driver also drove it in rash and\n            negligent manner and the accident took place\n            when two vehicles dashed against each other.\n            Both were coming from opposite direction, thus, it\n            was the duty of both the drivers to avoid the\n            collision in which they have failed. Thus, we\n            come to the conclusion that it is a case of\n            contributory negligence in equal proportion of\n            both drivers.\"</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p_8\">      Although we are of the opinion that the High Court in doing so\n\nshould have considered the matter at some details and it was further\n\nrequired to assign some reasons in support thereof, but, it is not necessary\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                     4</span>\n\n\nfor us to consider that aspect of the matter as the owner or the insurer of the\n\ntruck having not preferred any appeal, the same has attained finality.\n</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_9\">      In this appeal we are concerned with only one question, viz., as to\n\nwhether any case has been made out for enhancement of the amount of\n\ncompensation in favour of the appellant.\n</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_10\">7.    So far as the quantum of compensation is concerned, the Tribunal\n\nproceeded on the basis that the age of the deceased Shankarlal was 35 years.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">His monthly income was assessed at Rs. 1500/- per month. One-third of the\n\nsaid amount was deducted as his personal expenditure.           Applying the\n\nmultiplier of 10, it was held that the applicants were entitled to\n\ncompensation of Rs. 1,20,000/-.\n</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_12\">      As regards the quantum of compensation payable to the heirs and\n\nlegal representatives of the deceased Balma is concerned, the loss of\n\ndependency was determined at Rs. 12,000/- per annum by the Tribunal.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">Having regard to the fact that he was aged 25 years, the multiplier of 15 was\n\nused to hold that a compensation for a sum of Rs. 1,92,000/- should be\n\ngranted.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                      5</span>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_14\">      The deceased Ram Gopal was aged 31 years at the time of the\n\naccident.   A multiplier of 12 was used in his case and the amount of\n\ncompensation of Rs. 4,22,400/- was held to be payable to him on the\n\npremise that the loss of dependency was Rs. 34,200/- per annum.\n</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_15\">8.    The High Court, however, although did not interfere with these\n\nfinding of facts, applied the multiplier of 17 in all the cases.\n</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_16\">9.    Mr. Shiv Sagar Tiwari, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nappellant would contend that the High Court committed a serious error in\n\nholding that the multiplier of 17 should be applied in modification of the\n\norder of the Tribunal.\n</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_17\">10.   The liability to pay compensation in a case where a vehicle meets\n\nwith an accident is principally that of the owner thereof. The age of the\n\ndeceased as also the loss of dependency suffered by his heirs respectively\n\nand legal representatives is seriously not in dispute.\n</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_18\">11.   The core question, therefore, which arises for consideration is as to\n\nwhether the multiplier specified in the table contained in the Second\n\nSchedule appended to the Act should have been applied. Although the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                     6</span>\n\n\nSecond Schedule is applicable only in respect of the claim petitions filed\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/22871263/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 163A</a> of the Act, indisputably, the same provides for some\n\nguidelines.   In a case where the deceased was above 25 years but not\n\nexceeding 30 years, in terms of the said Second Schedule, the multiplier of\n\n18 is to be applied. In the case of the deceased whose age was above 30\n\nyears but not exceeding 35 years, the multiplier of 17 in terms of the Second\n\nSchedule is required to be applied.      The High Court, therefore, in our\n\nopinion, has applied the correct multiplier. The quantum of multiplicand, as\n\nnoticed hereinbefore, is not in question. In a case of this nature, it is not\n\nnecessary to go into the larger question, viz., as to whether the courts should\n\napply the multiplier specified in the Second Schedule in a proceeding under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/136948773/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 166</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p_19\">12.   <a href=\"/doc/1683465/\" id=\"a_4\">In General Manager, Kerala State Road Transport Corporation,\n\nTrivandrum v. Susamma Thomas and others</a>, [(1994) 2 SCC 176] apart\n\nfrom applying the structured formula for determination of the amount of\n\ncompensation with regard to the future prospect of the deceased, it was\n\nopined :-\n</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_20\">              \"19. In the present case the deceased was 39 years\n              of age. His income was Rs 1032 per month. Of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                        7</span>\n\n\ncourse, the future prospects of advancement in life\nand career should also be sounded in terms of\nmoney to augment the multiplicand. While the\nchance of the multiplier is determined by two\nfactors, namely, the rate of interest appropriate to a\nstable economy and the age of the deceased or of\nthe claimant whichever is higher, the\nascertainment of the multiplicand is a more\ndifficult exercise. Indeed, many factors have to be\nput into the scales to evaluate the contingencies of\nthe future. All contingencies of the future need not\nnecessarily be baneful. The deceased person in\nthis case had a more or less stable job. It will not\nbe inappropriate to take a reasonably liberal view\nof the prospects of the future and in estimating the\ngross income it will be unreasonable to estimate\nthe loss of dependency on the present actual\nincome of Rs 1032 per month. We think, having\nregard to the prospects of advancement in the\nfuture career, respecting which there is evidence\non record, we will not be in error in making a\nhigher estimate of monthly income at Rs 2000 as\nthe gross income. From this has to be deducted his\npersonal living expenses, the quantum of which\nagain depends on various factors such as whether\nthe style of living was spartan or bohemian. In the\nabsence of evidence it is not unusual to deduct\none-third of the gross income towards the personal\nliving expenses and treat the balance as the\namount likely to have been spent on the members\nof the family and the dependents. This loss of\ndependency should capitalize with the appropriate\nmultiplier. In the present case we can take about\nRs 1400 per month or Rs 17,000 per year as the\nloss of dependency and if capitalized on a\nmultiplier of 12, which is appropriate to the age of\nthe deceased, the compensation would work out to\n(Rs 17,000 x 12 = Rs       2,03,000) to which is\nadded the usual award for loss of consortium and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                    8</span>\n\n\n            loss of the estate each in the conventional sum of\n            Rs 15,000.\"\n</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_21\">      <a href=\"/doc/484625/\" id=\"a_5\">In Kaushnuma Begum v.

PW 4\n            brother of the deceased also supported the same\n            version. No contra-evidence has been adduced in\n            regard to that aspect. It is, therefore, reasonable to\n            believe that the monthly income of the deceased\n            was Rs. 1500. In calculating the amount of\n            compensation in this case we lean ourselves to\n            adopt the structured formula provided in the\n            Second Schedule to the <a href=\"/doc/785258/\" id=\"a_6\">MV Act</a>.

Tambwekar, learned Advocate, that the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court\n\nhad misconstrued the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/770112/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 17B</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947,\n\nwhich makes it very clear that in the event an award for reinstatement is stayed by a\n\nHigh Court or the Supreme Court, the employer would be liable to pay such\n\nworkman, during the period of pendency of such proceedings, full wages last drawn\n\nby him, inclusive of any maintenance allowance admissible to him under any rule,\n\nprovided that the workman had not been employed in any establishment during such\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                           3</span>\n\fperiod and an affidavit by such workman has been filed to that effect in such court.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">          Learned counsel reiterated the findings of the learned Single Judge that the\n\nworkmen concerned had not been gainfully employed during the period in question.\n\nMr.Tambwekar, accordingly, submitted that the order of the Division Bench of the\n\nHigh Court was liable to be set aside and that of the learned Single Judge restored.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">          Appearing for the respondent Samity, Ms.Ranjeeta Rohatagi, learned\n\nAdvocate, submitted that no interference is called for with the impugned order since\n\nthe Division Bench had considered the financial condition of the respondent Samity\n\nwhile passing the said order. She also urged that before the learned Single Judge, it\n\nhad been submitted on behalf of the Samity that in order to quantify the workmen's\n\ndues, the matter should be remitted to the Labour Court for the purpose of taking\n\nevidence as is done under <a href=\"/doc/483633/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 33C(2)</a> of the Act. However, such submission was\n\nalso rejected by the learned Single Judge and was not considered by the Division\n\nBench, while passing the impugned order.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">          We have considered the submissions made on behalf of the respective\n\nparties. Since interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/770112/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 17B</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, is\n\ncentral to the disposal of this appeal, the provisions thereof are extracted below:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                 \"17B. Payment of full wages to workman pending proceedings\n       in higher courts:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">       Where in any case, a Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal by its\n       award directs reinstatement of any workman and the employer prefers\n       any proceedings against such award in a High Court or the Supreme\n       Court, the employer shall be liable to pay such workman, during the\n       pendency of such proceedings in the High Court or the Supreme Court,\n       full wages last drawn by him, inclusive of any maintenance allowance\n       admissible to him under any rule if the workman had not been employed\n       in any establishment during such period and an affidavit by such\n       workman had been filed to that effect in such Court :\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                            4</span>\n<p id=\"p_14\">\f                  Provided that where it is proved to the satisfaction of the High\n       Court or the Supreme Court that such workman had been employed and\n       had been receiving adequate remuneration during any such period or\n       part thereof, the Court shall order that no wages shall be payable under\n       this section for such period or part, as the case may be.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">\n\n         The provisions of <a href=\"/doc/770112/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 17B</a> stipulates that when an Award of\n\nreinstatement of a workman is challenged by the employer before the High Court or\n\nthe Supreme Court and the operation of the same is stayed, the employer shall be\n\nliable to pay the workman, during the period of pendency of such proceedings, full\n\nwages last drawn by him. It also indicates that the same would be subject to the\n\nworkman filing an affidavit to satisfy the Court that he had not been gainfully\n\nemployed during the said period.      The said question has been set at rest by the\n\nlearned Single Judge in favour of the workmen.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">         The invocation of <a href=\"/doc/483633/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 33C(2)</a> of the aforesaid Act is also, in our view,\n\nmisconceived, having regard to the fact that <a href=\"/doc/483633/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 33C(2)</a> stands on a different\n\nfooting from <a href=\"/doc/770112/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 17B</a>. While under <a href=\"/doc/770112/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 17B</a> it is under the orders of the High\n\nCourt or the Supreme Court in a pending proceeding that the full wages last drawn\n\nby the workman, inclusive of any maintenance allowance admissible to him under\n\nany rule, is to be paid, <a href=\"/doc/483633/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 33C(2)</a>, on the other hand, provides for recovery of\n\nmoney due from the employer or any benefit which is capable of being computed in\n\nterms of money. The question of invocation of <a href=\"/doc/483633/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 33C(2)</a> arises only when there\n\nis a dispute as to the quantum of the dues. The two aforesaid provisions contemplate\n\ntwo different situations and in certain cases the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/483633/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 33C(2)</a> may\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                          5</span>\n\fhave to be resorted to in respect of an order under <a href=\"/doc/770112/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 17B</a>, but not as a matter of\n\ncourse. The necessary details required for giving effect to an order under <a href=\"/doc/770112/\" id=\"a_16\">Section\n\n17B</a> of the 1947 Act are available both with the employer as also the employee and\n\nonly involves a matter of calculation for which no evidence is required to be taken.\n\nFor better appreciation of the matter, the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/483633/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 33C(2)</a> are\n\nreproduced hereinbelow:\n</p>\n<pre id=\"pre_2\">         \"33C      Recovery of money due from an employer-\n\n                   (1) xxx xxx xxx\n\n                   (2) Where any workman is entitled to receive from the\n</pre><p id=\"p_17\">         employer any money or any benefit which is capable of being computed\n         in terms of money and if any question arises as to the amount of money\n         due or as to the amount at which such benefit should be computed, then\n         the question may, subject to any rules that may be made under this Act,\n         be decided by such Labour Court as may be specified in this behalf by\n         the appropriate Government within a period not exceeding three\n         months.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_18\">                  Provided that where the presiding Officer of a Labour Court\n         considers it necessary or expedient so to do, he may, for reasons to be\n         recorded in writing, extend such period by such further period as he\n         may think fit.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_19\">\n         Sub-sections (3), (4) and (5) of <a href=\"/doc/592257/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 32</a> of the Act define the procedure to\n\nbe followed for recovery of the dues as computed.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_20\">         In contrast, <a href=\"/doc/770112/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 17B</a> provides in unambiguous terms that if an award\n\nfor reinstatement of a workman is stayed at the instance of the employer, either by\n\nthe High Court or the Supreme Court, the employer will be liable to pay to the\n\nworkman during the pendency of the proceedings before the High Court or the\n\nSupreme Court full wages as last drawn by him, including any maintenance\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                           6</span>\n\fallowance admissible to him under any Rule, if the workman had not been gainfully\n\nemployed elsewhere during the said period.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_21\">         On the other hand, <a href=\"/doc/483633/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 33C(2)</a> of the aforesaid Act contemplates a\n\nproceeding requiring evidence to be taken to determine the quantum of the dues\n\npayable to the workman. Taking recourse to such a course of action as a matter of\n\ncourse would destroy and frustrate the very purpose of <a href=\"/doc/770112/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 17B</a> which, as has\n\nbeen consistently held by this Court, is to provide the workman with the means of\n\nsustenance of his family members and himself during the pendency of the\n\nproceedings taken by the employer before the High Court or the Supreme Court.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">         Apart from the above, while disposing of the letters patent appeal, the\n\nDivision Bench of the High Court has not also come to a finding which is different\n\nfrom the finding arrived at by the learned Single Judge in this regard.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">         During the course of the hearing of this appeal, Ms.Rohatagi brought to our\n\nnotice an order dated 6th August, 2007 and subsequent amendments made therein by\n\norders dated 31st October, 2007 and 5th March, 2008 passed in Letters Patent Appeal\n\nNo.138/2007, which had been filed against the final disposal of the writ petition. It\n\nhas been submitted by her that since the learned counsel of the appellant Association,\n\nrepresenting the workmen, had agreed that they would be entitled to get the benefits\n\nof the interim order passed by the Division Bench, the present appeal had been\n\nrendered infructuous.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_24\">         We are unable to find any merit in the said submission, having regard to\n\nthe observations made herein-above regarding the effect of <a href=\"/doc/770112/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 17B</a> of the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                           7</span>\n\f<a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_23\">Industrial Disputes Act</a> regarding payment of full wages to a workman as last drawn\n\nby him during the pendency of the proceedings either before the High Court or\n\nbefore this Court in which the award of reinstatement is stayed.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_25\">         We, accordingly, allow the appeal, set aside the order          passed by the\n\nDivision Bench of the Bombay High Court and restore that of the learned Single\n\nJudge dated 31st August, 2006.

Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a learned Single Judge\n\nof the Calcutta High Court allowing the Second Appeal filed by the\n\frespondents under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (in\n\nshort the `CPC').\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">3.    The appellant as plaintiff filed a suit for declaration of title and\n\nrecovery of khas possession and also of permanent injunction contending\n\ninter-alia that the suit land in R.S. Khatian No.31 of Mouza Chandibera\n\nunder P.S. Rajarhat originally belonged to Ananda Chandra Mondal, Mubir\n\nMondal, Bhutnath Mondal, Gadadhar Mondal, Mathar Mondal, Kartick\n\nMondal, Haradhan Chandra Ghosh and Bishwanath Ghosh. While they were\n\nin joint possession in same for convenience of possession they made an\n\namicable partition amongst themselves and in that partition plaintiff and\n\nproforma defendant No.3 got 12 decimals of land in plot No.223/455 which\n\nwas described in schedule A of the plaint. Subsequently, by an amicable\n\npartition between the plaintiff and proforma defendant No.3, plaintiff got B\n\nschedule property, that is to say, 6 decimals of land at the southern portion\n\nof the aforesaid suit property and proforma defendant No.3 got 6 decimals\n\nof land at the northern portion of the suit plot. In this way, plaintiff got B\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                      2</span>\n\fschedule of land and C schedule of land fell in the share of pro-defendant\n\nno.3. Thereafter, as per the case of the plaintiff by way of an oral exchange,\n\ndefendants 1 and 2 got C schedule property from proforma defendant No.3\n\nand they started residing thereon by constructing house. B schedule of land\n\nwas lying vacant. Plaintiff was in possession of that land by cultivation.\n\nDefendant Nos.1 and 2 threatened the possession of the plaintiff. In that\n\nbackground, the plaintiff filed the suit originally for permanent injunction\n\nagainst defendants 1 and 2. Subsequently, it was contended by the plaintiff\n\nthat defendant Nos.1 and 2 dispossessed the plaintiff from the suit property\n\nand, therefore, the plaintiff prayed for recovery of possession of such\n\nproperty. Defendant Nos.1 and 2 contested the suit by a written statement\n\nalleging inter-alia that the plaintiff was all along since the date of partition\n\nremained separately in his own allotted land and the defendants also were\n\npossessing the land and structure according to their own share on the\n\nportion allotted to them. In this background, they denied the allegation of\n\ndispossession from the suit property made by the plaintiff. It was the further\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                        3</span>\n\fallegation of the contesting defendants that the total land were amicably\n\npartitioned amongst themselves by the intervention of the members of the\n\ngram Panchayat as per the family arrangements. The parties were separated\n\nin respect of the possession of the land in dispute and the contesting\n\ndefendants after getting the plan sanctioned, constructed the building over\n\nthe allotted land. The plaintiff was not entitled to get a decree as prayed for.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">4.    Learned Munsiff formulated several issues and relied on certified\n\ncopy of the decreed suit. The first Appellate Court has also upheld the view\n\nof the trial Court. The Second Appeal was admitted with the following\n\nquestions of law:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">      (i)    Whether the learned Judge in the courts below\n\n      substantially   erred    in   law   in   completely    misleading,\n\n</pre><p id=\"p_10\">      misconstruing and misappreciating the scope of the suit for\n\n      declaration, injunction and recovery of possession between the\n\n      co-sharers in the absence of any legal and valid partition and\n\n      erroneously decreed the suit on a misconception of law?\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                         4</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">\f(ii)    Whether the learned Judge in the courts below\n\nsubstantially erred in law in decreeing the suit by declaring that\n\nthe plaintiff/respondent No.1 has right, title and interest in\n\nrespect of `B' schedule suit property and for recovery of\n\npossession of the said property by evicting the appellants\n\ntherefrom inasmuch as the learned Judge in the courts below\n\nhave failed to appreciate that all the parties to the proceeding\n\nare co-sharers having joint share in the suit property and as\n\nsuch before valid partition neither of the co-sharers could be\n\ndirected to vacate some portion of the joint property?\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">(iii)   Whether the learned Judge in the courts            below\n\nsubstantially erred in law in dismissing the appeal on a\n\nmisconception of law inasmuch as per the provision of Section\n\n14 of the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1955 any partition\n\namong the co-sharers other than by a registered instrument or\n\nby a decree or order of a Court is not partition at all and in\n\nabsence of any valid partition among the parties, the\n\nplaintiff/respondent No.1 cannot claim for injunction to prevent\n\nother co-sharers from enjoying joint share in the property.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                 5</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">\f5.    The High Court answered question No.3 in favour of the present\n\nrespondents and it held that the partition, if any, did not take place prior to\n\nthe introduction of Section 14 of the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1955\n\n(in short the `Act').\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">6.    Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that there was no dispute\n\nregarding the date of partition. In fact, no issue was framed. In the plaint\n\nthere was a specific assertion with reference to the R.S.R.O.R. which\n\nundisputedly is of the year 1955. Though the defendants filed written\n\nstatement there was no challenge to the authenticity of the R.S.R.O.R.\n\nThough the High Court noted that there was an admission strangely it came\n\nto hold that the admission was as regards the point of law and, therefore,\n\ndecided the appeal in favour of the respondents.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">7.    Learned counsel for the respondents, on the other hand, supported the\n\njudgment of the High Court and submitted that though it appeared that there\n\nwas no specific issue relating to the date of partition there was denial as\n\nregards the factum of partition as claimed.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_18\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                       6</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">\f8.    The High Court noted that the section came into force in West Bengal\n\nw.e.f. 7.6.1965 except in the areas transferred from Bihar to West Bengal.\n\nTherefore, after the introduction of the aforesaid provision the partition of a\n\nholding can be effective only by registered instrument or by decree or order\n\nof a Court. There is no dispute so far as this aspect is concerned. As rightly\n\ncontended by learned counsel for the appellant there was specific averments\n\nin the plaint as regards the partition which refers to R.S.R.O.R. Though,\n\nthere was no date of partition indicated, a reference was made to the\n\naforesaid document. The High Court after having noted that none of the\n\nparties made any endeavour to ascertain when the actual alleged partition\n\ntook place came to an abrupt conclusion that from the facts and\n\ncircumstances it was clear that the partition, if any, did not take place prior\n\nto the introduction of Section 14 of the Act. The basis for coming to such a\n\nconclusion is not clear. Further, the conclusion of the High Court that\n\nthough there may have been admission that related to the question of law is\n\nequally unsustainable. What is the date of partition is not a question of law.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">9.    In the circumstances, we set aside the impugned judgment of the High\n\nCourt and remit the matter to the trial Court to formulate the following\n\nissues:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_21\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                       7</span>\n\f             What is the date of alleged partition between the plaintiff\n\n      and original defendant No.3;\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_22\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">             The parties shall be permitted to place evidence in\n\n      support of their respective stand.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_24\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_25\">10.

One Chauthmal is said to have entered into an agreement of sale\n\ndated 11.8.1980 followed by an agreement dated 24.11.1988 agreeing to sell\n\n20 bighas of land in Khasra No.9 in Sukhalpura village to Shiva Co-\n\noperative Housing Society Ltd. (for short `Society'). The said agreement is\n\nsaid to have confirmed (i) that payment of the entire price of 20 bighas of\n\nland was made by the society to Chauthmal; (ii) that possession of the land\n\nagreed to be sold was delivered to the society; and (iii) that out of 20 bighas\n\nagreed to be sold, 5 bighas of land stood in the name of other persons and\n\nChauthmal would ensure that an agreement was executed by them also in\n\nfavour of the society in regard to that extent.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">4.    Some lands in Sukhalpura village, including 31 bighas in Khasra\n\nNo.9, were acquired for a housing scheme floated by Rajasthan Housing\n\nBoard (for short, `the Board') under preliminary notification dated 5.4.1985\n\nand final notification dated 16.10.1985 issued under the <a href=\"/doc/7832/\" id=\"a_2\">Land Acquisition\n\nAct</a>, 1894 (`Act' for short). Khasra No.9 was shown as `Sivaya Chak'\n\n(government land) in the said notification and possession thereof was\n\ndelivered to the Housing Board on 13.6.1988.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                     3</span><p id=\"p_10\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">5.    Chauthmal is said to have filed a revenue suit for a declaration that\n\nKhasra No.9 was not government land and that he was one of the owners of\n\nthe said land and for consequential reliefs. The said suit was decreed on\n\n10.9.1986, and was affirmed by the Revenue Board, Ajmer. In pursuance of\n\nit, the following five persons were shown as owners of Khasra No.9 in the\n\nrevenue records, their share being shown in brackets : Chauthmal (15/33),\n\nMohanlal (2/33), Geeta Devi (2/33), Kaushaliya Devi (1/33) and\n\nKanhaiyalal (13/33).\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">6.    The State Government formulated a scheme enabling the land owners\n\nto opt for allotment of developed land equal to 15% of acquired land in lieu\n\nof the compensation for the acquired land. The cases where the land\n\nowners opt for such allotment, were to be considered by an Allotment\n\nCommittee, to decide upon the requests after due inquiry into title and after\n\nascertaining that there were no claims or court-cases.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">7.    The land owners/power of Attorney holders of Khasra No.9\n\napproached the Board for such allotment. One Kailash Chand who claimed\n\nto be the successor (legatee) of Chauthmal was one of them and he claimed\n\nallotment of developed land in lieu of 15 bighas of acquired land. The\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                    4</span>\n\n\nsociety also appears to have filed an application before the Board on\n\n21.12.2001 claiming compensation in respect of 20 bighas in Khasra No.9\n\non the basis of the agreement of sale. The claim of the society was rejected\n\non 8.7.2002.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">8.    On 17.7.2002 the power of attorney holders of four owners of Khasra\n\nNo.9 (Kailash Chand, Mohanlal, Geeta Devi and Kanhaiyalal) entered into\n\nseparate agreements with the Housing Board, consenting for allotment of\n\ndeveloped land (15% of the extent of the acquired land) in lieu of\n\ncompensation.     In the said agreements, the land owners asserted and\n\ndeclared that their respective shares in the land were not subject to any\n\nencumbrance and no dispute or litigation was pending in regard to the same.\n\nAfter an inquiry, the Allotment Committee accepted the request and a\n\nsettlement award dated 22.7.2002 was passed by the Special Officer of\n\nRajasthan Housing Board recording the agreement to allot 15% developed\n\nland in lieu of compensation in respect of 28 bighas 17 Biswas in Khasra\n\nNo.9 (as the remaining 2 bighas 3 Biswas out of 31 bighas notified, was\n\nfound to be under encroachment). Pattas were issued subsequently in regard\n\nto such allotted land.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                     5</span><p id=\"p_17\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">9.    Thereafter, the members of the society filed a complaint before the\n\nBoard claiming that the society ought to have received the said 15%\n\ndeveloped land in lieu of compensation relating to the 20 bighas of acquired\n\nland. Some members of the society, through a forum known as Mithila\n\nNagar Suraksha &amp; Vikas Samiti also made a representation to the Chief\n\nMinister on 17.10.2005 alleging that the Khatedars/power of attorney\n\nholders of Khasra No.9 in collusion with the Special Officer had practiced\n\nfraud and grabbed the valuable land from the Rajasthan Housing Board. The\n\nChief Minister's office appears to have suggested action on such\n\nrepresentation. In pursuance of it, the appellant on behalf of the Board\n\nlodged an FIR on 7.11.2005 (at about 9.20 p.m.), alleging that the\n\nKhatedars/Power of Attorney holders of Khasra No. 9 had made false\n\nrepresentations to the Board, and in collusion with the Special Officer of the\n\nBoard and office bearers of the society, had fraudulently obtained allotment\n\npattas in the year 2002.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_19\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">10.   First respondent herein who claimed to be the owner of 13 bighas in\n\nKhasra No.9 and respondent No. 2 herein who was his attorney holder, filed\n\na petition under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_3\">section 482</a> of the Code for quashing the FIR on the ground\n\nthat the averments made in the FIR did not make out a prima facie case\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                     6</span>\n\n\nagainst them, even if the allegations in the FIR was taken to be true. The\n\nHigh Court by the impugned order dated 24.2.2006 allowed the said petition\n\nand quashed the FIR insofar as respondents 1 and 2 as also the Special\n\nOfficer of the Board on the following two grounds :\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_21\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">(i)    The Land Acquisition Officer, when passing an award under <a href=\"/doc/26767651/\" id=\"a_4\">Section\n11(2)</a> of the Act functions as a \"Judge\" as defined in <a href=\"/doc/1807029/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 19</a> of the\nIndian Penal Code (`<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_6\">IPC</a>' for short) and therefore, is entitled to the\nprotection of <a href=\"/doc/306489/\" id=\"a_7\">section 77</a> IPC. Therefore making a settlement award by the\nSpecial Officer of the Board granting developed land in lieu of\ncompensation to the land owners could not, under any circumstances, give\nrise to an offence under the penal Code.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_23\">\n</p><p id=\"p_24\">(ii)   The allegations in the FIR did not constitute an offence of cheating or\nforgery punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_8\">Sections 420</a>,<a href=\"/doc/1985627/\" id=\"a_9\">467</a>,<a href=\"/doc/556166/\" id=\"a_10\">468</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1466184/\" id=\"a_11\">471</a> of IPC.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_25\">11.    The said order of the High Court is challenged in these two appeals\n\nby special leave. The first is filed by the complainant namely the Deputy\n\nHousing Commissioner of Rajasthan Housing Board. The second is filed by\n\n`Mithila Nagar Nyay Manch' claiming to represent the members of the\n\nsociety. On the contentions urged, two questions arise for consideration:-\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                     7</span>\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_26\">(i)    Whether the immunity under <a href=\"/doc/306489/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 77</a> IPC is available to a\nCollector/Land Acquisition Officer/Special Officer who makes an award, by\nway of settlement or otherwise, under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/7832/\" id=\"a_13\">Land Acquisition\nAct</a>, 1894.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_27\">\n</p><p id=\"p_28\">(ii)   Whether the allegations in the FIR did not constitute an offence under\n<a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_14\">sections 420</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1985627/\" id=\"a_15\">467</a>,<a href=\"/doc/556166/\" id=\"a_16\">468</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1466184/\" id=\"a_17\">471</a> of IPC.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_29\">\n\nRe : Question No.(i)\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_30\">12.    <a href=\"/doc/306489/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 77</a> IPC provides that nothing is an offence which is done by a\n\nJudge when acting judicially in the exercise of any power which is, or which\n\nin good faith he believes to be, given to him by law. <a href=\"/doc/1807029/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 19</a> IPC defines\n\na `Judge' as denoting not only every person who is officially designated as a\n\nJudge, but also every person who is empowered by law to give in any legal\n\nproceedings, civil or criminal, a definitive judgment, or a judgment which, if\n\nnot appealed against, would be definitive, or a judgment which, if confirmed\n\nby some other authority, would be definitive, or who is one of a body of\n\npersons empowered by law to give such a judgment.            The question is\n\nwhether the Collector (or any officer appointed by the appropriate\n\ngovernment or other acquiring authority) performing functions assigned\n\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/7832/\" id=\"a_20\">Land Acquisition Act</a>, can be said to be a `Judge' as defined in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                    8</span>\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1807029/\" id=\"a_21\">section 19</a> IPC, that is, a person empowered by law to give a definitive\n\njudgment in a legal proceeding and acting judicially in the exercise of such\n\npower.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_31\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_32\">13.   The findings of the High Court that a Collector/Land Acquisition\n\nOfficer making an award under <a href=\"/doc/26767651/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 11(2)</a> of the Act is entitled to the\n\nimmunity of a Judge under <a href=\"/doc/306489/\" id=\"a_23\">section 77</a> IPC, is based on the following\n\nreasoning :\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_33\">\"Once an agreed award is passed by the competent authority and that award\nacquires the status of an executable decree under the law, the evidence\nwhich came before the competent authority on the basis of which such\naward is passed, cannot be subjected to investigation by the police\nauthorities.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_34\">\n\nThe respondents also supported the said finding by referring to the various\n\nprovisions of the Act relating to the powers exercised by the Collector\n\n(which term includes not only the Collector of a District or Deputy\n\nCommissioner, but any officer specially appointed by the appropriate\n\nGovernment to perform the functions of a Collector under the Act). <a href=\"/doc/1990166/\" id=\"a_24\">Section\n\n9</a> requires the Collector to cause public notice to be given stating that the\n\nGovernment intends to take possession of land in pursuance of the\n\nacquisition and that claims to compensation for all interests in such land\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                     9</span>\n\n\nmay be made to him. <a href=\"/doc/742973/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 10</a> empowers the Collector to require any\n\nsuch person to make a statement containing the names of persons possessing\n\nany interest in the land and of the nature of such interest etc. <a href=\"/doc/291273/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 11</a>\n\nauthorizes and requires the Collector to hold an enquiry and make an award\n\nin regard to the true area of land, the compensation which, in his opinion\n\nshould be allowed for the land, and the apportionment of the compensation\n\namong all the persons interested in the land. It also provides that no award\n\nshall be made by the Collector without the previous approval of the\n\nappropriate Government or officer authorized by it. <a href=\"/doc/948147/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 12</a> provides\n\nthat the award so made shall be final and conclusive evidence as between\n\nthe Collector and the person interested, of the true area and value of the land\n\nand the apportionment of the compensation among the persons interested.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1857501/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 13</a> empowers the Collector to adjourn the inquiry from time to time\n\nfor any cause he deems fit. <a href=\"/doc/196014452/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 13A</a> empowers the Collector to correct\n\nany clerical or arithmetical mistakes in the award within six months.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/475622/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 14</a> empowers the Collector for the purpose of enquiries under the\n\nAct, to summon and enforce the attendance of witnesses, including the\n\nparties interested or any of them and to compel the production of documents\n\nby the same means and so far as may be in the same manner, as is provided\n\nin the case of a Civil Court only or of Civil procedure Code. <a href=\"/doc/1235658/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 15</a>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                    <a href=\"/doc/742973/\" id=\"a_32\">10</a></span>\n\n\nrequires the Collector to be guided by the provisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/31609/\" id=\"a_33\">Section\n\n23</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1485112/\" id=\"a_34\">24</a> of the Act in determining the amount of compensation. Having\n\nregard to the said provisions, it was contended that the powers and functions\n\nexercised by the Collector under the Act were judicial powers of a Civil\n\nCourt in rendering definitive judgments and therefore a Collector making an\n\naward, determining the compensation is a Judge as defined in <a href=\"/doc/1807029/\" id=\"a_35\">section 19</a>\n\nIPC.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_35\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_36\">14.    On the other hand, the appellant contended that the Land Acquisition\n\nOfficer merely makes an offer on behalf of the Government/Acquiring\n\nAuthority and does not discharge any judicial functions. It was also\n\nsubmitted that the award made by the Collector does not bind the claimants,\n\nas they have the choice of not accepting the award and requiring the\n\nCollector to refer the matter to the Civil Court for determination of the\n\ncompensation. The appellants pointed out that while <a href=\"/doc/634137/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 26</a> the Act\n\nspecifically provided that the award by the `Judge' (Reference Court) shall\n\nbe deemed to be a decree and the statement of the grounds of such award, a\n\njudgment, <a href=\"/doc/291273/\" id=\"a_37\">section 11</a> contains no such provision in regard to the awards by\n\nCollector.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                     11</span><p id=\"p_37\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_38\">15.   The question whether the Collector/Land Acquisition Officer while\n\nmaking an enquiry and award under the Act, acts in a judicial capacity or\n\nnot, has been considered in a series of judgments. The well settled\n\nprinciples are :\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_39\">\n</p><p id=\"p_40\">(a)   Any inquiry as to the market value of property and determination of\nthe amount of compensation by the Collector, is administrative and not\njudicial in nature, even though the Collector may have power to summon\nand enforce the attendance of witnesses and production of documents. In\nmaking an award or making a reference or serving a notice, the Collector\nneither acts in judicial nor quasi judicial capacity but purely in an\nadministrative capacity, exercising statutory powers as an agent and\nrepresentative of the Government/Acquiring Authority.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_41\">(b)   The award by a Collector is merely an offer of the amount mentioned\nas compensation, on behalf of the Government/Acquiring Authority to the\nperson/s interested. It is neither an executable decree, nor binds the owners\nor persons interested in the acquired property.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_42\">\n</p><p id=\"p_43\">(c)   The Collector does not function as a Judicial Officer who is required\nto base his decision only on the material placed in the enquiry in the\npresence of parties, but functions as a valuer who ascertains the market\nvalue on material collected from all sources, personal inspection and his\nown knowledge and experience.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                     12</span><p id=\"p_44\">\n\n\n(See the decision of the Privy Council in Ezra vs. Secretary State -1905 (32)\n\nIndian Appeals 93, the decision of the Patna High Court in Gokul Krishna\n\nBanerji vs. Secretary of State - AIR 1932 Pat. 134 and the decisions of this\n\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/214713/\" id=\"a_38\">Raja Harish Chandra Raj Singh vs. The Dy.

Only Judges (as defined in <a href=\"/doc/1807029/\" id=\"a_43\">section 19</a> IPC) acting judicially are\n\nentitled to the protection under <a href=\"/doc/306489/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 77</a> IPC. The Collector is neither a\n\nJudge as defined under <a href=\"/doc/1166255/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 19</a> nor does he act judicially, when\n\ndischarging any of the functions under the Act. Therefore he is not entitled\n\nto the protection under <a href=\"/doc/306489/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 77</a> IPC. The decision of the High Court that\n\nthe FIR is to be quashed as the subject matter of the complaint related to the\n\naction taken by the Collector/Special Officer in his capacity as a `Judge' is\n\nopposed to law and therefore, liable to be set aside.\n\n\nRe : Question No. (ii)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                     13</span>\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_48\">17.   The complaint by the members of the society was in regard to the 20\n\nbighas of land out of Khasra No. 9 in regard to which late Chauthmal is\n\nalleged to have agreed to sell to the society under agreements dated\n\n11.8.1980 and 24.11.1988. The members of the society gave a complaint to\n\nthe Board claiming that the compensation payable (or 15% developed land\n\nin lieu of compensation) in respect of the said 20 bighas of land, had to be\n\ngiven to the society and not persons claiming to be legal heirs of\n\nChauthmal. It was also their contention that on account of collusion among\n\nthe successor of Chauthmal and his attorney holder, the Special Officer of\n\nthe Board, and the office bearers of the society, the 15% developed land was\n\nallotted to persons who were not entitled to allotment, thereby defrauding\n\nthe society and the Board. The respondents 1 and 2 approached the High\n\nCourt pointing out that neither the society nor the members of the society, at\n\nany point of time had made any claim in regard to the 13 bighas in Khasra\n\nNo.9, which belonged to first respondent, that the entire complaint related\n\nto 20 bighas agreed to be sold by Chauthmal to the society, and that as there\n\nwas no complaint of irregularity or commission of any offence in regard to\n\nthe 13 bighas of land belonging to the first respondent, there was no\n\nquestion of involvement of first respondent or his attorney holder (second\n\nrespondent) in any offence of cheating or forgery. It is not in dispute that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                     14</span>\n\n\neven the suit filed by the society, that was said to be pending at the relevant\n\ntime was against Chauthmal in regard to the 20 bighas in Khasra No.9 and\n\nthat no suit or proceeding was pending in regard to the remaining 13 bighas\n\nclaimed by the first respondent. Only in January, 2003, second respondent\n\nand some others were impleaded in the said suit relating to 20 bighas, in\n\npursuance of an application filed on 14.11.2002, long after respondents 1\n\nand 2 had executed the agreement and consent award had been made. The\n\nHigh Court, therefore, rightly held that the allegations in the FIR, even if\n\naccepted as true, did not relate to the respondents 1 and 2 but to others who\n\nhad claimed to be the owners/attorney holders in regard to remaining 20\n\nbighas of land.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_49\">\n</p><p id=\"p_50\">18.   Having regard to the well settled principles laid down in <a href=\"/doc/1033637/\" id=\"a_47\">State of\n\nHaryana v. Bhajan Lal</a> - 1992 Suppl. (1) SCC 335; <a href=\"/doc/39679/\" id=\"a_48\">Indian Oil Corporation\n\nv. NEPC India Ltd</a>. - 2006 (6) SCC 736; <a href=\"/doc/855018/\" id=\"a_49\">Inder Mohan Goswami v. State of\n\nUttaranchal</a> - 2007 (12) SCC 1, we are of the view that the High Court was\n\njustified in holding that the allegations even if taken at their face value did\n\nnot prima facie constitute an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_50\">sections 420</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1985627/\" id=\"a_51\">467</a>, <a href=\"/doc/556166/\" id=\"a_52\">468</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1466184/\" id=\"a_53\">471</a>\n\nIPC, by respondents 1 and 2.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_51\">\n</p><p id=\"p_52\">19.   The leaned counsel for the appellants next submitted that even if the\n\nquashing of the FIR qua respondents 1 and 2 was upheld, the quashing of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">\f                                    15</span>\n\n\nthe FIR against the Special Officer of the Board was unwarranted. While\n\nrespondents 1 and 2 were concerned only with 13 bighas which was not the\n\nsubject matter of the agreement with the society, the FIR specifically\n\nalleged collusion between Kailash Chand and the Special Officer of the\n\nBoard, in regard to 20 bighas of land which was agreed to be sold to the\n\nsociety by Chauthmal. In fact the writ petition filed by Kailash Chand for\n\nquashing the FIR was rejected by the High Court. (Civil W.P.\n\nNo.9293/2005 decided on 23.11.2005). As the finding of the High Court\n\nthat the Collector/Special Officer was a Judge has been set aside, the\n\nquashing of the FIR with reference to the Special Officer, cannot be upheld.\n\nTo this extent, the contention of the appellants merits acceptance and the\n\nquashing of the FIR with reference to the then Special Officer is set aside.\n\nThe quashing of FIR as against respondents 1 and 2 will have no bearing on\n\nthe FIR in so far as the other accused with reference to the 20 bighas of\n\nland. Nor anything stated above shall be construed as a finding on the\n\nmerits.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_53\">\n</p><p id=\"p_54\">20.

Appellant was convicted for commission of an offence punishable\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 302</a> of the Indian Penal Code. He was sentenced to undergo\n\nimprisonment for life. Allegations against him were that on or about\n\n9.5.1994 at about 1.00 p.m. he committed murder of one Pittala\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                    2</span>\n\nChandrakala by pouring kerosene over her and setting her on fire with a\n\nmatchstick.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">3.    One of the grounds taken by him during trial was that he was a\n\njuvenile within the meaning of the provisions of Juvenile Justice Act, 1986\n\n(for short, \"the said Act\") on the date of commission of offence.\n\nIndisputably, the date of birth of the appellant is 10.5.1978. The question,\n\nhowever, which arises for consideration is as to whether he had completed\n\nthe age of 16 years on 9.5.1994.        During the trial, it appears, such a\n\ncontention was rejected by the learned trial judge opining that he was not a\n\njuvenile as no reliance could be placed on the date of his birth recorded in\n\nthe registers of the primary school.      A revision application was filed\n\nthereagainst before the High Court. By reason of a judgment and order\n\ndated 26.7.2000, the matter was remanded back to the trial court. Relying\n\non or on the basis of a decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/161448/\" id=\"a_2\">Arnit Das vs. State of Bihar</a>\n\n[(2000) 5 SCC 488], it was held that the date of production of the appellant\n\nbefore the learned Magistrate being 25.5.1994 and assuming that the date of\n\nbirth of the accused was 10.5.1978, he was not a juvenile within the\n\nmeaning of the provisions of the said Act.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                             3</span><p id=\"p_8\">\n\nThe learned Sessions Judge, held:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      \"The learned Advocate feebly contended that the\n      accused should be treated as a juvenile on the date\n      of offence as per the decision reported in 2000\n      Supreme Court (Crl) 1270, ALT 2002 AP 511\n      page, ALT 2002 AP 485, SCC 2000 Vol. II page\n      1270 and AIR 1972, SC 1557. With due respect to\n      all the above decisions, I express my inability to\n      accept the contention of the learned advocates for\n      the accused. As already stated by me earlier the\n      accused in this case has preferred Criminal\n      Revision Case No. 418 of 2000 before the Hon'ble\n      High Court of Andhra Pradesh aggrieved by the\n      earlier order of this Court refusing to accept him\n      as a juvenile. In the order dated 26.7.2000, the\n      Hon'ble High Court of Andhra Pradesh has\n      specifically directed this Court to follow the\n      decision reported in Arnit Das Vs. State of Bihar\n      2000 (4) Supreme 186. Therefore, I am bound by\n      the order of the Hon'ble High Court and I cannot\n      take a divergent view. I therefore, find that there\n      is no force in the argument advanced by the\n      learned counsel for the accused in this behalf. I\n      accept the contention of the learned Public\n      Prosecutor that the accused was not a juvenile on\n      the date when he was brought before the Court. On\n      an analysis of the entire evidence on record, I hold\n      that the prosecution has successfully driven home\n      the guilt of the accused under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 302</a> IPC\n      beyond the reasonable doubt.\"\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                    4</span>\n\n<p id=\"p_10\">4.

In terms of the final decree passed in Suit No.467 of 1970 the\n\nCalcutta High Court, the appellant claimed to have become the absolute\n\nowner of the suit property. The aforesaid Durga Bala Acooli had inducted\n\none Ratan Chandra Byen as monthly tenant in respect of premises i.e. land\n\nwith structures and/or sheds. On 2.11.1981 the Calcutta Thika Tenancy\n\n(Acquisition &amp; <a href=\"/doc/1489134/\" id=\"a_1\">Regulation) Act</a>, 1981 (in short the `Act') came into force.\n\nOn 5.5.1982 in exercise of power conferred by Section 20 of the Act the\n\nState Government framed Calcutta Thika Tenancy (Acquisition &amp;\n\nRegulation) Rules, 1981 (in short the `Rules') which became operative from\n\nthat date and under Rule 3(a) of the Rules, the Thika tenants were directed\n\nto file Return under Form-A before the Thika Controller within 240 days\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                      2</span>\n\ffrom the date of commencement of the Act. However, the Thika Controller\n\nwas given power to extend the time not exceeding six months subject to\n\nfiling of an application for condonation of delay.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">      According to the appellant the tenant was paying rent to the owner of\n\nthe said premises after the death of Durga Bala Acooli in 1969. The\n\nappellant collected rent upto the months of August and September, 1986.\n\nThe last payment was made on 14.3.1987 relating to September 1986.\n\nSeveral writ petitions were filed before the High Court challenging the\n\nvalidity of the Act. By judgment dated 8.7.1987 it was held as follow:\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">            \"Within the scope and ambit of <a href=\"/doc/782097/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 5</a> of the\n      impugned Act only lands comprised in Thika Tenancy within\n      the meaning of Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act, 1949 namely\n      Kutcha structure and/or Pucca structure constructed for\n      residential purpose, with the permission of the Thika Controller\n      under the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act, 1949 and Khatal land\n      held under a lease shall vest and save as aforesaid no other\n      lands and structure vests under the impugned Act.

Against the\n\njudgment of the High Court an appeal was preferred before this Court. In\n\nCivil Appeal Nos. 3713-3900 of 1987 an order of status quo as on the date\n\nwas directed to be maintained. On 18.2.1988 the respondents replied to the\n\nnotice sent by the appellant's advocate denying that the appellant was not\n\ntheir landlord. Since the tenant failed to hand over the vacant and peaceful\n\npossession a title suit was instituted for recovery of possession, damages\n\nand/or mesne profits and other reliefs which was numbered as Title Suit 68\n\nof 1988. Shri Birendra Chandra Bayen, defendant No.4 in the civil suit\n\nfiled an application under <a href=\"/doc/614006/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 17(2)</a> and Section 2A and 2B of the\n\nTenancy Act before learned Civil Judge, Junior Division 4th Court, Alipore.\n\nThe appellant also filed a petition on 23.7.1988 in connection with the\n\napplication under Section 17(2) of the Tenancy Act denying the allegations.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">      According to the appellant Shri Birendra Chandra Bayen by filing a\n\npetition not only admitted on oath that appellant was the landlord of the\n\npremises but also sought for a direction upon the appellant to repair the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                     4</span>\n\fsheds and structures of the premises. Since the deceased after 7 years from\n\nthe date of coming into force of the Act filed Return under Section Form-A\n\nof Rule 3(a) of the Rules before the Thika Controller claiming to be the\n\nThika tenant of the property without notice to the appellant, the controversy\n\nin real sense starts from this point. On 4.10.1989 the Inspector of Regional\n\nOffice of Thika Controller provisionally accepted the Return subject to the\n\nverification of tenancy and without any legal right. Such acceptance was\n\nmade without notice to the appellant and also without disclosing the fact\n\nthat the civil suit was pending between the parties. Such acceptance of rent\n\nwas without prejudice to the right of the Government and without creating\n\nany right of the tenant. After the provisional acceptance of rent, Shri\n\nBirendra Chandra Bayen filed an application in the pending suit that in view\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/1272508/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 5</a> of the Act, the suit is not maintainable. The High Court on\n\nrevision application being C.O.2670/1990 directed that the preliminary\n\npoint raised by the defendant would be decided at the final hearing of the\n\nsuit. When the appellant came to know about the filing of the Return in\n\nForm-A under Rule 3(a) without application for condonation of delay\n\nduring the pendency of the civil suit, he raised an objection by filing an\n\napplication before the Thika Controller against the preliminary acceptance\n\nof rent and prayed for determination under <a href=\"/doc/1272508/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 5</a> of the Act inasmuch as\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                     5</span>\n\fthere was no provision in the Act to prefer an appeal under <a href=\"/doc/106689/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 13</a> of the\n\nAct against the provisional acceptance of the Return. Since the objection\n\nwas not considered for a long time, appellant filed a writ petition before the\n\nCalcutta High Court for a direction to the Thika Controller to decide\n\nwhether the said property has been vested to the State. The High Court\n\ndisposed of the writ petition directing the Thika Controller to dispose of the\n\nrepresentation after giving hearing to the parties. In terms of the aforesaid\n\norder of the Thika Controller he concluded that the property had not been\n\nvested to the State under <a href=\"/doc/1272508/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 5</a> and Shri Birendra Chandra Bayen was\n\nnot the Thikha tenant. The learned Munsif disposed of the application of\n\nlate Birendra Chandra Bayen under Section 17(2) and 2A and 2B of the\n\nTenancy Act determining the relationship between the parties of the suit as\n\nlandlord and tenant under the Tenancy Act. Thus, this application had\n\nbecome final. Against the order dated 8.12.1993 of the Thika Controller,\n\nlegal heirs of Shri Birendra Chandra Bayen preferred a statutory appeal\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/106689/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 13</a> of the Act before learned District Judge who dismissed the\n\nsame holding that the defendants could not produce any document that they\n\nwere Thika tenants and the Controller had jurisdiction to pass an order\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1272508/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 5</a> of the Act. Respondent No.1 filed an application under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India, 1950 (in short the `Constitution')\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                      6</span>\n\fchallenging the aforesaid order of the District Judge which was transferred\n\nto the Tribunal.

On 19.8.2003 the\n\nState of West Bengal withdrew the appeal before this Court. On 23.2.2004\n\na Division Bench of the High Court by an impugned order allowed the writ\n\napplication and set aside the order of Thika Controller, Appellate Tribunal\n\nand the Tribunal holding that the predecessor-in-interest of respondent No.1\n\nwas accepted as Thika tenant. Against the adjudication under <a href=\"/doc/1272508/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 5(3)</a>\n\nof the Act, no appeal was preferred and as such the application of the\n\nappellant for cancelling the recording of Thika tenancy is not maintainable\n\nand there is no provision in the Act empowering the Thika Controller to\n\nentertain such application after declaration of the Thika tenant.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">4.    Stand of learned counsel for the appellant essentially is that there was\n\nno question of condonation of delay of an application which was filed after\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                                      8</span>\n\fabout 7 years. The eviction suit was filed on 14.3.1988 and rent was paid till\n\n1986 under the Tenancy Act and thereafter it was stopped. It is pointed out\n\nthat under Section 17 of the Tenancy Act if the application is on the\n\nground of default, an application can be made to make the deposit. The\n\napplication dated 25.4.1988 is still pending. On 4.10.1989 the only\n\nendorsement was of provisional acceptance subject to verification.

The representation made by the appellant was on 16.11.1992. It was\n\nhowever unnecessary as there was no order. The High Court inter-alia had\n\ndisposed of earlier writ petition by directing the Controller to consider and\n\ndispose of the representation. The High Court by the impugned judgment\n\nseems to have over-looked the fact that there was in fact no cancellation.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">6.       Learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand supported the\n\norder.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_18\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">7.       In the impugned order the High Court seems to have proceeded on the\n\nbasis that there was cancellation. It noted as if the Thika Controller was\n\nmoved for cancelling the order recording the tenancy. As a matter of fact\n\nthere was no cancellation and there was a provisional order. There was no\n\nquestion of preferring an appeal unless the final order is passed. So far as\n\nthe onus is concerned, it is on the appellant to establish the tenancy. It needs\n\nto be noted that on the Return no order was passed. The Thika Controller,\n\nAppellate Authority and the Tribunal came to positive finding that\n\nrespondent No.1 was not a Thika tenant. They took decision on the basis of\n\nthe High Court's order to deal with a representation of the appellant.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                         10</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">\f8.    In view of the aforesaid we are satisfied that the order of the High\n\nCourt is indefensible.

As the Return is in terms of Rule 3, the revenue authority\n\nhas to decide the matter.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_21\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">9.

Leave granted.\n</p><p id=\"p_4\">\f2.    Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a learned Single\n\nJudge of the Calcutta High Court dismissing the application filed under\n\nSection 401 read with <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973\n\n(in short the `Code'). Challenge in the Criminal Revision Petition was to the\n\norder passed in Criminal Appeal No.2 of 2004 by learned Additional\n\nSessions Judge, Asansol confirming the judgment and order of conviction\n\nand sentence dated 22.4.2004 passed by learned Additional Chief Judicial\n\nMagistrate, Asansol.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">3.    Since the appellant did not appear when the matter was called, the\n\nmatter was taken ex-parte. The High Court noted that a sum of\n\nRs.2,30,000/- was payable to the complainant-respondent No.1 herein by\n\nthe present appellant -accused and since the payment was not made there\n\nwas an agreement between the parties to stipulate the mode of payment. A\n\nsum of Rs.2,30,000/- was to be paid in 8 instalments and the first instalment\n\nwas of a sum of Rs.50,000/- payable by 22.6.2002 and the 8th instalment of\n\nRs.10,000/- was payable by 28.2.2003. As a security for the payment, the\n\nappellant issued three cheques. One of the cheques was of Rs.1 lakh and\n\nthat is the subject matter of present controversy. Stand was taken that since\n\nthe cheque was issued as a security, the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 138</a> of the\n\nNegotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (in short the `Act') had no application.\n\nThe High Court noticed that the appellant failed to pay Rs.2,30,000/- in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                    2</span>\n\finstalments as agreed to and therefore because of default of payment cheque\n\nof Rupees one lakh was presented. In that sense there is no question of any\n\nsecurity.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">4.    Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that because of\n\nunavoidable difficulties there was no appearance when the matter was\n\ncalled. It was submitted that the matter was suddenly appeared in the list\n\nand due to some unavoidable difficulties, the appellant's advocate could\n\nnot appear at the time of hearing before learned Single Judge.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">5.    Learned counsel for the respondents on the other hand submitted that\n\non two dates the appellant did not appear and, therefore, the Court had no\n\noption but to dismiss the revision petition on merits. It appears from the\n\nrecords that case was filed in 2005 and was listed on 17.3.2008 for the first\n\ntime and on the next day it was dismissed for non prosecution.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">6.    Learned counsel for the appellant highlighted several difficulties\n\nwhich stood on the way of learned counsel for the appellant to appear before\n\nthe Court when the matter was taken up. It is true that the lawyers are\n\nexpected to be vigilant once they accept a brief. But on the peculiar facts of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                     3</span>\n\fthe case we set aside the impugned order and remit the matter to the High\n\nCourt for a fresh consideration on merits. To avoid unnecessary delay the\n\nparties are directed to appear before the concerned Court on 28.1.2009.

Being aggrieved by the Order passed by the High Court in its\n\nRevisional Jurisdiction and issuing certain directions, appellants have come\n\nup before this Court. The appellants herein are the original plaintiffs and\n\nthe legal representatives of one of the original plaintiffs.    First three\n\nappellants are the original plaintiffs, while the other three are the legal\n\nrepresentatives of one Abdul Salam Shora, who was the original plaintiff\n\nNo. 2.   During the pendency of this appeal, appellant No. 1 died on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f0                                   2</span>\n\n28.11.2007. Vide order dated 25.3.2008, his legal representatives were\n\nbrought on record. They filed a suit for perpetual injunction against the\n\nrespondents/defendants, whose defence was that the appellants/plaintiffs\n\nwere encroaching upon the portion of land, which they alleged to have\n\npurchased and which is adjacent to the land in question. The location,\n\nidentification and plaintiffs' title and possession over the suit land was not\n\ncontroverted by the respondents/defendants in their written statement.\n\nTwo issues came to be framed and subsequently two additional issues also\n\ncame to be framed and ultimately, the suit was decreed, after about 14\n\nyears of its filing by the Court of Sub-Judge, Srinagar. Admittedly, this\n\njudgment had become final, since no appeal was filed against this\n\njudgment. However, since the respondents/defendants did not obey the\n\nterms of the decree and did not allow the appellants/plaintiffs to fence the\n\nland, which was in their possession and which was identifiable and\n\nsufficiently delineated in the suit, Execution Application was filed in March,\n\n1987 for issuing directions to the respondents/defendants to comply with\n\nthe terms of decree dated 18.10.1984. An objection came to be raised by\n\nthe Judgment-Debtors before the Executing Court that the decree was un-\n\nexecutable, since the identity of the land in respect of which the decree\n\nwas passed, was itself not established. This objection was upheld by the\n\nExecuting Court by its order dated 21.6.1988.         Against this order, a\n\nRevision Petition was filed by the appellants herein before the High Court\n\nvide Revision No. 153 of 1988. The Revision stood allowed by the High\n\nCourt by its judgment dated 25.8.1998, whereby, the order of the Executing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f0                                   3</span>\n\nCourt was set aside and the Executing Court was directed to proceed with\n\nthe execution of the decree. The High Court had observed in the judgment\n\nthat the Executing Court had not taken any steps to identify the suit land,\n\nthough the factors like extent and limits of the suit land were available. The\n\nextent of the suit land was 1 canal 12 marlas, which was clearly given in\n\nKhewat and Khasra Numbers, while its location was given as Brari Nambal.\n\nIt was found that no attempt was made by the Executing Court to look out\n\nfor situational and other identifiable features and locale of the land even\n\nfrom the suit file, Revenue records including `Aksilatha'. Therefore, it was\n\nrecommended that a Commissioner should be appointed for local\n\ninvestigation and if required, the oral evidence also could be taken. The\n\nHigh Court further observed that even the site plan coupled with the\n\npermission of Srinagar Municipality to raise the wall accorded to the decree\n\nholders for fencing or walling of the suit land, was not taken into\n\nconsideration and it appeared that the Executing Court had gone by\n\nwhatever had been raised and stated by the Judgment-Debtors alone,\n\nwithout arriving at an independent decision regarding executability of the\n\ndecree, in totality of facts and circumstances of the case.      It was also\n\nobserved by the High Court that a decree cannot be defeated by reason of\n\ntechnical or hyper-technical objection and those unconnected with the\n\nrealities on the ground level.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">3.    After this decision, the respondents/defendants filed an Application-\n\ncum-Reply/Statement, in which it was stated that the appellants/plaintiffs\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f0                                          4</span>\n\nhad grabbed the land of the respondents/defendants and under the garb of\n\nthe   decree,       they    were        trying   to     grab    the   land   of   the\n\nrespondents/defendants, adjacent to the suit land, which land was required\n\nto be protected by the Court. It was, therefore, prayed that the Revenue\n\nAuthorities should be directed to demarcate the land, so that the decree-\n\nholders    are      not    able    to     grab   the     land    belonging   to   the\n\nrespondents/defendants.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">4.    Much prior to this, Srinagar Municipality had granted permission to\n\nthe appellants/plaintiffs for fencing of the suit land, which was demarcable\n\nand identifiable.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">5.    However, on this application, three persons were appointed as\n\nCommissioners, two of them were from the Revenue Department and one\n\nwas from the Srinagar Municipality. They visited the spot on 7.12.2004 in\n\npresence of the parties, when the Deputy Director of Estates Department\n\nwas also present on the spot, and after detailed inspection, the decreetal\n\nland measuring 1 canal 12 marlas was found to be in possession of the\n\ndecree holders, i.e., the appellants.                 The decreetal land was also\n\ndemarcated. A site plan was prepared and the report was submitted to the\n\nCourt on 30.12.2004.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">6.    On receipt of this report, the Executing Court gave an opportunity to\n\nthe parties to file their objections to the abovesaid Report. The counsel for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f0                                      5</span>\n\nthe respondents/defendants appeared before the Court on 16.5.2005 and\n\nhe also had made a Statement that he was satisfied with the Report of the\n\nCommissioners and he accepted the same as correct. Thereafter, various\n\norders were passed by the Executing Court, and the Court went to the\n\nextent   of    issuing     the     coercive     measures,   compelling       the\n\nrespondents/defendants to obey the decree. The first such order dated\n\n14.12.2005 was not even challenged by the respondents in time, while by\n\nthe second passed order dated 27.6.2006, the Director of Estates was\n\ndirected to file an undertaking regarding the acknowledgement of the\n\ndecree and demarcation of land.             It is against these orders dated\n\n14.12.2005 and 27.6.2006 that a Revision Petition came to be filed before\n\nthe High Court, wherein, a totally new case was set up, which had no\n\nconnection    with   the   execution       matter.   Very   significantly,   the\n\nrespondents/defendants had accepted the facts regarding the previous\n\nRevision Petition No. 153 of 1988 decided on 25.8.1998. After filing of the\n\nsaid Revision Petition, the respondents herein requested for placing certain\n\ndocuments on record.             According to the appellants/plaintiffs, the\n\nrespondents/defendants tried to manipulate the record, which could not\n\nhave been considered in the Revision Petition by the High Court. The\n\nappellants/plaintiffs filed objections to the respondents' request of\n\nproduction of documents, in which it was contended that the documents\n\ncan not be produced at the stage of Revision because by doing so, the\n\nwhole case was tried to be reopened, and there was an attempt on the part\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f0                                    6</span>\n\nof the respondents/defendants to adduce fresh evidence, which too was\n\nmanipulated and manufactured.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">7.    However, it seems that the High Court allowed that Application by its\n\norder dated 23.11.2006, even without hearing the appellants. During that\n\ntime, no lawyer used to appear in the Court due to the strike call given by\n\nthe militants in the Valley of Kashmir. The Court went on to allow this\n\napplication, and the appellants filed a detailed Application on 4.12.2006 for\n\nrecalling the order dated 23.11.2006. Ultimately, it seems that the High\n\nCourt passed the final judgment on 7.9.2007, whereby, the High Court\n\ngave a finding in the following words:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">             \"Accordingly, and in view of what has been stated above, I feel\n             that the decreetal land whatever and wherever it is, is yet to be\n             duly identified and demarcated without which the execution\n             proceedings run the risk of being misdirected. So before\n             passing final orders hereupon, I feel it would be proper to seek\n             suggestions of appearing sides regarding mode and method of\n             identifying the decreetal land, so that the decree under\n             reference is properly executed and without any further loss of\n             time.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      The appellants, feeling aggrieved by this, have come up before us.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_15\">8.    The Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants pointed\n\nout that there was no question of passing these fresh directions,\n\nparticularly, in the wake of finalized order in the earlier Civil Revision dated\n\n25.8.1998.    Our attention was invited to the said order and more\n\nparticularly, the observations made therein, to which we have already\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f0                                      7</span>\n\nmade reference in the earlier part of the judgment. Even at the cost of\n\nrepetition, we must note that the High Court has clearly observed therein\n\nas follows:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">               \"What the Executing Court has exactly failed to do is that it has\n               not taken any steps to identify the suit land. The extent and\n               limits of the suit land despite available evidence on record has\n               not been determined. This aspect has not been considered.\n               The extent of suit land (1 canal 12 marlas) is clearly given with\n               Khewat No. and Khasra No. The location of the land is given\n               as Brari Nambal. No attempt has been made by the Executing\n               Court to look out for situational and other identifiable features\n               and locale of the land even from the suit file, revenue records\n               including `Aksilatha' and may be through appointment of\n               Commissioner for local investigation and if required, on an\n               enquiry where oral evidence could have been taken. Even the\n               site plan coupled with permission of Srinagar Municipality to\n               raise the wall accorded to the decree holders for\n               fencing/walling of the suit land has not been taken into\n               consideration. It appears that the Executing Court has gone\n               by whatever has been raised and stated by the respondent-\n               judgment Debtors, without arriving at an independent decision\n               regarding the executability of the decree in the totality of facts\n               and circumstances of the case. The Executing Court appears\n               to have been in a hurry to rush to the conclusion that the\n               decree is un-executable for the ambiguity and vagueness as\n               sighted by the Executing Court.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"p_16\">The learned counsel pointed out that by these observations, the High Court\n\nhad finally held that the land had been finally identified and that the\n\nExecuting Court was duty bound to execute the decree in respect of such\n\nidentified land, which was clear from the Khewat and Khasra Numbers, as\n\nalso the permission granted by Srinagar Municipality to the appellants to\n\nbuild a wall. Our attention then was invited to the Commissioners' Report,\n\nwherein, as many as two officers of the respondents'/defendants'\n\ndepartment were present, as also the Deputy Director of Estates\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f0                                  8</span>\n\nDepartment. It was pointed out that the Commissioners' Report had finally\n\nclinched the issue by locating the said land. Our attention was invited even\n\nto the sketch map drawn by the Commissioners. It was then pointed out by\n\nthe learned counsel that the order dated 27.6.2006 read with order dated\n\n14.12.2005, passed by the Executing Court, which was impugned before\n\nthe High Court in the Revision, was clear enough, inasmuch as, in the\n\norder dated 14.12.2005, it was clearly mentioned that:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">            \"To cope up with the problem, this Court has also vide its order\n            dated 10.7.2004 read with the order dated 16.8.2004 &amp;\n            15.9.2004 got the decreetal land demarcated on 7.12.2004\n            through a commission for local inspection.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">                  The Commission has already submitted its report on\n            31.12.20004, which is on the file. The commission in its report\n            has submitted that the demarcation of the decreetal land was\n            conducted on spot in presence of both the parties on\n            7.12.2004. It has been reported that Deputy Director, Estates\n            (Mr. Farooq Ahmad Lone) was present on behalf of the\n            judgment debtors. It has been unambiguously reported that\n            the decree holder were found the recorded owners, as well as\n            in the physical possession of the decreetal land which was\n            demarcated.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">                  It is most pertinent to mention that the Ld. Standing\n            Counsel for judgment debtors on 16.5.2005 had admitted in\n            the open court that he admits the report of the commission\n            and has no objection vis-`-vis the same.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">                   But, despite the demarcation of the decreetal land, the\n            judgment debtors are persisting in their attempt of interference\n            with the decreetal land by objections on spot the construction\n            of the fencing wall by the decree holder around the decreetal\n            land.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"p_17\">It was also found in that order that in spite of the demarcation of the\n\ndecreetal land, the Judgment-Debtors were persisting in their attempt of\n\ninterference with the decreetal land by objecting to the construction of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f0                                   9</span>\n\nfencing wall.   In that order, the Executing Court has very specifically\n\nobserved that the objections of the Judgment-Debtors were already stood\n\nrejected by the High Court in its order dated 25.8.1998. Ultimately, the\n\nCourt went up to the extent of observing:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">            \"As such, the judgment debtor Director Estates, Srinagar\n            against whom the decree is sought to be executed is liable to\n            be committed to civil prison for compelling him to implement\n            the decree. The office is directed to issue bailable warrant of\n            arrest in the amount of rupees thirty thousand for his\n            appearance in person before this Court on 18.1.2006, which\n            shall be entrusted to the S.S.P., Jammu for execution. The\n            warrant shall be accompanied with a copy of this order put up\n            on 18.1.2006.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"p_18\">On the heels of this order came the order dated 27.6.2006, wherein, the\n\nExecuting Court noted that the Judgment-Debtor was not satisfied with the\n\ndemarcation, which was already conducted in the case during execution\n\nprocess.   It seems that on that day, the Judgment-Debtor was present\n\nbefore the Executing Court, which had issued a non-bailable warrant\n\nagainst him. The Court, then went on to observe that the conduct of the\n\nJudgment-Debtors was contemptuous.           The Court also noted that the\n\nexecution was pending disposal right from 4.3.1987 and that made it a\n\nrarest of the rare case. It seems that these two orders were composedly\n\nchallenged before the High Court in the Revision. The learned counsel,\n\nappearing on behalf of the respondents tried to feebly support the order of\n\nthe High Court. However, one look at the High Court suggests that the\n\nHigh Court has gone on to reopen the whole process. It has undoubtedly,\n\nmade a reference to some documents and on the basis of those\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f0                                    10</span>\n\ndocuments, the Court seems to have observed in para 5 that the land\n\nunder reference was sold by one Mehraj-ud-din S/o Assad              Shah and\n\nGhulam Nabi S/o Ghulam Shah to one Khazir Mohammad S/o Subhan\n\nParey, who sold the same to Government in January, 1969. The Court\n\nfurther observed that the sale of land by aforesaid persons is shown to\n\nhave been effected sometime prior to December, 1968, when the\n\nconcerned Patwari had entered the mutation regarding it, while the other\n\npart of the land comprising of Survey No. 1659/1667 measuring 6 marlas is\n\nshown to have been mutated in favour of Government on 2.1.1960. A very\n\ncurious observation is made thereafter, by the High Court as under:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">             \"At the same time, however, as per copy of the judgment, the\n             decree holders had before the trial Court in their plaint claimed\n             ownership of the land under reference under a sale deed\n             purported to have been executed in their favour by Ghulam\n             Nabi Shah S/o Ghulam Ali Shah reportedly executed on 12th\n             and registered on 28th March, 1968. Accordingly, the root of\n             the controversy appears to be lying somewhere here. If\n             Ghulam Nabi Shah aforesaid who is shown as son of Ghulam\n             Ali Shah and Ghulam Shah in photocopy of mutation No. 1004\n             above mentioned had sold the land to Khazir Mohammad S/o\n             Subhan Parrey aforesaid before it is sold to decree holders in\n             March, 1968 then obviously their claim would be defective.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"p_19\">We do not know, as to how, such observations could be made regarding\n\nthe appellants'/plaintiffs' title, particularly, in view of the decree which had\n\nfinally been passed. This seems to be the main reason why the High Court\n\nhas interfered in the matter. Even the observations made by the High\n\nCourt in para 6 of the impugned judgment regarding the Commissioners'\n\nReport, could not have been made, particularly, because the counsel for\n\nthe    respondents/defendants       unequivocally      had     accepted     the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f0                                   11</span>\n\nCommissioners' Report, which is clear from the earlier orders passed by\n\nExecuting Court on 27.6.2006 and referred to earlier. In short, the High\n\nCourt in its Revisionary jurisdiction has tried to go behind the decree, which\n\nis not permissible. The High Court has also returned a finding of fact in\n\npara 8 that the decreetal land was yet to be duly identified and demarcated\n\nand, thereafter, the High Court has chosen to open a Pandora's box by\n\ninviting the suggestions from both the sides for identifying the decreetal\n\nland, which had already been identified by the Commissioners' report.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">9.    In short, the High Court has exceeded its jurisdiction in the matter\n\nand has chosen to allow itself to be swept away by some documents,\n\nwhich though available to the respondents/defendants, were never\n\nbothered to be filed either while the Civil Suit was in progress or even\n\nduring the execution. We do not know how and under what provision, the\n\nsaid documents came to be produced at the Revisional stage, even without\n\nhearing the appellants/plaintiffs, who were parties to that Revision.               In\n\nshort, the impugned order is clearly erroneous and suffers from the\n\njurisdictional error and the same is, therefore, set aside. The appellants\n\nshall be entitled to proceed on the basis of the Commissioners' Report,\n\nwhile the respondents/defendants would be bound by the subsequent\n\norders dated 14.12.20005 and 27.6.2006 passed by the Executing Court.\n\nUnder the circumstances, the appeal is allowed with costs.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">                                             ......................................J.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f0                 12</span><p id=\"p_22\">\n\n                       (Markandey Katju)\n\n\n\n                        ......................................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">                       (V.S.

The High Court has upheld\n\nthe said view.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">           A Constitution Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/179794777/\" id=\"a_1\">Secretary, State of Karnataka and\n\nOrs. vs. Umadevi</a> (3) and Ors. [2006 (4) SCC 1], has categorically held that keeping in\n\nview the constitutional scheme of equality, as contained in Articles 14 and 16 of the\n\nConstitution of India, regularisation or permanent continuance of temporary,\n\ncontractual, casual, daily-wage or ad hoc employees in public employment dehors the\n\nconstitutional scheme is impermissible in law.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">           By way of one time concession the Constitution Bench, however, held as\n\nunder:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">         \"53. One aspect needs to be clarified. There may be cases where\n         regular appointments (not illegal appoints) as explained in S.V.\n         Narayanappa (1967 1 SCR 128), R.N. Nanjundappa (1972 1 SCC 409)\n         and B.N. Nagarajan (1979 4 SCC 507) and referred to in para 15\n         above, of duly qualified persons in duly sanctioned vacant posts might\n         have been made and the employees have continued to work for ten\n         years or more but without the intervention of orders of the courts or\n         of tribunals. The question of regularisation of the services of such\n         employees may have to be considered on merits in the light of the\n         principles settled by this Court in the cases abovereferred to and in\n         the light of this judgment. In that context, the Union of India, the\n         State Governments and their instrumentalities should take steps to\n         regularise as a one-time measure, the services of such irregularly\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                             3</span>\n\n       appointed, who have worked for ten years or more in duly sanctioned\n       posts but not under cover of orders of the courts or of tribunals and\n       should further ensure that regular recruitments are undertaken to fill\n       those vacant sanctioned posts that require to be filled up, in cases\n       where temporary employees or daily wagers are being now employed.\n       The process must be set in motion within six months from this date.\n       We also clarify that regularisation, if any already made, but not sub\n       judice, need not be reopened based on this judgment, but there should\n       be no further bypassing of the constitutional requirement and\n       regularising or making permanent, those not duly appointed as per\n       the constitutional scheme.\"</blockquote><p id=\"p_9\">\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">         We may notice that the law in this behalf has been laid down by the\n\nConstitution Bench of this Court, stating:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">       \"43. Thus, it is clear that adherence to the rule of equality in public\n       employment is a basic feature of our Constitution and since the rule of\n       law is the core of our Constitution, a court would certainly be disabled\n       from passing an order upholding a violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 14</a> or in\n       ordering the overlooking of the need to comply with the requirements\n       of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 14</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 16</a> of the Constitution. Therefore,\n       consistent with the scheme for public employment, this Court while\n       laying down the law, has necessarily to hold that unless the\n       appointment is in terms of the relevant rules and after a proper\n       competition among qualified persons, the same would not confer any\n       right on the appointee. If it is a contractual appointment, the\n       appointment comes to an end and the end of the contract, if it were an\n       engagement or appointment on daily wags or casual basis, the same\n       would come to an end when it is discontinued. Similarly, a temporary\n       employee could not claim to be made permanent on the expiry of his\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                        4</span>\n\nterm of appointment. It has also to be clarified that merely because a\ntemporary employee or a casual wage worker is continued for a time\nbeyond the term of his appointment, he would not be entitled to be\nabsorbed in regular service or made permanent, merely on the\nstrength of such continuance, if the original appointment was not\nmade by following a due process of selection as envisaged by the\nrelevant rules. It is not open to the court to prevent regular\nrecruitment at the instance of temporary employees whose period of\nemployment has come to an end or of ad hoc employees who by the\nvery nature of their appointment, do not acquire any right. The High\nCourts acting under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, should not\nordinarily   issue   directions   for       absorption,   regularisation,   or\npermanent continuance unless the recruitment itself was made\nregularly and in terms of the constitutional scheme. Merely because\nan employee had continued under cover of an order of the court,\nwhich we have described as 'litigious employment' in the earlier part\nof the judgment, he would not be entitle to any right to be absorbed or\nmade permanent in the service. In fact, in such cases, the High Court\nmay not be justified in issuing interim directions, since, after all, if\nultimately the employee approaching it is found entitled to relief, it\nmay be possible for it to mould the relief in such a manner that\nultimately no prejudice will be caused to him, whereas an interim\ndirection to continue his employment would hold up the regular\nprocedure for selection or impose on the State the burden of paying an\nemployee who is really not required. The courts must be careful in\nensuring that they do not interfere unduly with the economic\narrangement of its affairs by the State or its instrumentalities or lend\nthemselves the instruments to facilitate the bypassing of the\nconstitutional and statutory mandates.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_12\">  In view of the said decision of the Constitution Bench, there cannot be any\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                           5</span>\n\ndoubt whatsoever that the 1989 regularisation scheme having not been enforced in the\n\ncase of the respondent, it did not come within the purview of the exception carved out\n\nby the Court in paragraph 53, of Umadevi as quoted above. The view of the\n\nConstitution Bench in Umadevi (supra) has been reiterated by a three-Judge Bench of\n\nthis Court in Official Liquidator vs. Dayanand and Ors. [2008 (10) SCC 1], stating\n\nthat the High Courts shall give effect thereto, opining:\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">       \"90. We are distressed to note that despite several pronouncements on\n       the subject, there is substantial increase in the number of cases\n       involving violation of the basics of judicial discipline. The learned\n       Single Judges and Benches of the High Courts refuse to follow and\n       accept the verdict and law laid down by coordinate and even larger\n       Benches by citing minor difference in the facts as the ground for doing\n       so. Therefore, it has become necessary to reiterate that disrespect to\n       the constitutional ethos and breach of discipline have grave impact on\n       the credibility of judicial institution and encourages chance litigation.\n       It must be remembered that predictability and certainty is an\n       important hallmark of judicial jurisprudence developed in this\n       country in the last six decades and increase in the frequency of\n       conflicting judgments of the superior judiciary will do incalculable\n       harm to the system inasmuch as the courts at the grass roots will not\n       be able to decide as to which of the judgments lay down the correct\n       law and which one should be followed.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">       91. We may add that in our constitutional set-up every citizen is under\n       a duty to abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and\n       institutions. Those who have been entrusted with the task of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                            6</span>\n\n       administering the system and operating various constituents of the\n       State an who take oath to act in accordance with the Constitution and\n       uphold the same, have to set an example by exhibiting total\n       commitment to the constitutional ideals. This principle is required to\n       be observed with greater rigour by the members of judicial fraternity\n       who have been bestowed with the power to adjudicate upon important\n       constitutional and legal issues and protect and preserve rights of the\n       individuals and society as a whole. Discipline is sine qua non for\n       effective and efficient functioning of the judicial system. If the courts\n       command others to act in accordance with the provisions of the\n       Constitution and rule of law, it is not possible to countenance violation\n       of the constitutional principle by those who are required to lay down\n       the law.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">       92. In the light of what has been stated above, we deem it proper to\n       clarify that the comments and observations made by the two-Judge\n       Bench in <a href=\"/doc/1569551/\" id=\"a_6\">U.P. SEB v.

Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the\n\nMadhya Pradesh High Court upholding the conviction of the appellant for\n\noffence punishable under Section 302 read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 34</a> of the Indian\n\nPenal Code, 1860 (in short the `<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a>') as was awarded by learned Additional\n\nSessions Judge, Panna, in Sessions Trial No.15/1992.\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">\f3.    Prosecution version as unfolded during trial is as follows:\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">      On 30th November, 1991 at about 5.00 p.m. Ram Kishore (hereinafter\n\nreferred to as the `deceased') was murdered in an agricultural field. First\n\nInformation Report was lodged by Manik Lal at Police Station, Pawal in the\n\nevening at about 7.00 p.m. Offence was registered as Crime No.124/91\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_4\">34</a> IPC. Deceased had eloped with Lalli, sister of the\n\nRamcharan (A-2) and both of them had performed court marriage. The court\n\nmarriage was registered and Lalli was livng with Ramkishore. The appellant\n\nwas having enmity on account of aforesaid incident. Deceased after eloping\n\nwith Lalli was living in some other village and returned to his village a\n\nmonth before the incident. Ramkishore had gone to answer the call of nature\n\nin the evening on 30.11.1991 at about 4.30 p.m. towards the agricultural\n\nfield of Gadka. Around 5 p.m. Phulla (A-3) armed with axe, Ramcharan (A-\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">2) armed with sword alongwith Dayashankar (A-1) and Munni Lal (A-4)\n\nwent to the field of Gadaka. Munni Lal and Dayashankar were barehanded.\n\nPhulla gave axe blow on the head of deceased. Thereafter, Dayashankar and\n\nMunnilal the co accused pulled the legs of deceased and threw him on the\n\nground. Ramkishore fell on the crops in the field. Ramcharan assaulted the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                    2</span>\n\fdeceased by sword on the chest. Then he placed his sword on the chest of\n\nthe deceased. On account of beating he died. Police after receiving\n\ninformation of the commission of crime carried out the investigation,\n\narrested the accused persons and filed the challan on 3.1.1992 before the\n\nCourt of Judicial Magistrate. Case was committed to the Court of Sessions\n\nJudge. Trial Court framed charges under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_6\">34</a> IPC against the\n\naccused persons. After recording the evidence the trial Court convicted the\n\naccused persons for offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_7\">Sections 302</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 34</a> IPC\n\nand sentenced them as afore-noted.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">      Before the High Court the basic stand was that the prosecution failed\n\nto prove common intention on the part of the appellants and, therefore,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 34</a> had no application. The individual act of the appellant should\n\nhave been considered. Merely because the appellant had accompanied other\n\naccused persons, that cannot be sufficient to warrant presumption of\n\ncommon intention.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">4.    Learned counsel for the State submitted that the eye witnesses PWs 2\n\nand 3 had described the act of each of the appellants and the role ascribed to\n\nthe appellant was that he pulled the leg of the deceased as a result of which\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                     3</span>\n\fdeceased fell in the field of Masur crop and thereafter he was assaulted by\n\nother accused persons. The appeal was dismissed accepting the stand of the\n\nState.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">5.       Learned counsel for the appellant re-iterated the stand taken before\n\nthe High Court and submitted that <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 34</a> IPC has no application.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">6.       Learned counsel for the State on the other hand supported the\n\njudgment.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">7.       <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 34</a> has been enacted on the principle of joint liability in the\n\ndoing of a criminal act. The Section is only a rule of evidence and does not\n\ncreate a substantive offence. The distinctive feature of the Section is the\n\nelement of participation in action. The liability of one person for an offence\n\ncommitted by another in the course of criminal act perpetrated by several\n\npersons arises under <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 34</a> if such criminal act is done in furtherance of\n\na common intention of the persons who join in committing the crime. Direct\n\nproof of common intention is seldom available and, therefore, such\n\nintention can only be inferred from the circumstances appearing from the\n\nproved facts of the case and the proved circumstances. In order to bring\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                      4</span>\n\fhome the charge of common intention, the prosecution has to establish by\n\nevidence, whether direct or circumstantial, that there was plan or meeting of\n\nmind of all the accused persons to commit the offence for which they are\n\ncharged with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 34</a>, be it pre-arranged or on the spur of\n\nmoment; but it must necessarily be before the commission of the crime. The\n\ntrue contents of the Section are that if two or more persons intentionally do\n\nan act jointly, the position in law is just the same as if each of them has done\n\nit individually by himself. As observed in <a href=\"/doc/673120/\" id=\"a_14\">Ashok Kumar v. State of Punjab</a>\n\n(AIR 1977 SC 109), the existence of a common intention amongst the\n\nparticipants in a crime is the essential element for application of this\n\nSection. It is not necessary that the acts of the several persons charged with\n\ncommission of an offence jointly must be the same or identically similar.\n\nThe acts may be different in character, but must have been actuated by one\n\nand the same common intention in order to attract the provision.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">8.    The Section does not say \"the common intention of all\", nor does it\n\nsay \"and intention common to all\". Under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 34</a> the\n\nessence of the liability is to be found in the existence of a common intention\n\nanimating the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance\n\nof such intention. As a result of the application of principles enunciated in\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                      5</span>\n\f<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 34</a>, when an accused is convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 302</a> read with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 34</a>, in law it means that the accused is liable for the act which\n\ncaused death of the deceased in the same manner as if it was done by him\n\nalone. The provision is intended to meet a case in which it may be difficult\n\nto distinguish between acts of individual members of a party who act in\n\nfurtherance of the common intention of all or to prove exactly what part was\n\ntaken by each of them. As was observed in <a href=\"/doc/865810/\" id=\"a_19\">Ch. Pulla Reddy and Ors. v.\n\nState of Andhra Pradesh</a> (AIR 1993 SC 1899), <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 34</a> is applicable even\n\nif no injury has been caused by the particular accused himself. For applying\n\n<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 34</a> it is not necessary to show some overt act on the part of the\n\naccused.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_19\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">9.    The evidence of PWs 2 and 3 did not attribute any overt act to the\n\nappellant. The mere fact that he was in the company of the accused who\n\nwere armed would not be sufficient to attract <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 34</a> IPC. It is\n\nundisputed that appellant was not armed and he had no animosity with the\n\ndeceased. This position is also accepted by the prosecution. Additionally,\n\nthe stand that he pulled the leg of the deceased has not been established.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                     6</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">\f10.   In the peculiar facts of the case therefore it would be appropriate that\n\nthe appellant cannot be held guilty by application of <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 34</a> IPC. His\n\nconviction is accordingly set aside. He be set at liberty forthwith unless\n\nrequired to be in custody in connection with any case.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">11.

Challenge in these appeals is to the judgment of a Division Bench of\n\nthe Allahabad High Court dismissing the appeal filed by the five appellants\n\nbefore the High Court. The present appellants, his two sons Yatindra and\n\nSurendra alongwith Ram Kripal, Gajendra and Govind were tried by\n\flearned IInd Additional Sessions Judge, Mainpuri for alleged commission\n\nof offences punishable under Sections 147, 148, 302 read with Section 149\n\nand Section 307 read with <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 149</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in\n\nshort the `<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a>').

Life\n\nsentence, five years rigorous imprisonment and two years rigorous\n\nimprisonment respectively were imposed.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">3.    Background facts in a nutshell are as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">      The informant Vijay Bahadur is a resident of village Sakaragarhi, P.S.\n\nKishni, district Mainpuri. There was a litigation between Smt. Rama Devi\n\nand appellant Raj Nath resident of Nagla Tara in which Raj Nath lost in the\n\nlitigation before court. In the said litigation, informant Vijay Bahadur had\n\nhelped Smt. Rama Devi. Four months prior to the incident Rama Devi had\n\nsold 16 bighas of her land to Lokeshwar Nath (PW-2) nephew of informant\n\nwhich sale was not relished by the appellant Raj Nath and his sons and they\n\nstarted nurturing animosity for the informant. On 18.5.1978 appellant Raj\n\nNath and others plucked Jackfruits from trees standing over the land\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                        2</span>\n\fpurchased by Lokeshwar Nath regarding which a first information report\n\nwas lodged by him.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">      On the date of the incident i.e. 5.6.1978 at 6.00 P.M. Vijay Bahadur\n\nalong with his sons Narendra Nath and Mahendra             accompanied by\n\nLokeshwar Nath and Shrawan Kumar had gone to the house of his cousin\n\nRam Prakash in village Nagla Tara, also the village of the accused, for\n\nhearing Bhagwat and to participate in the feast thereafter. After taking meal\n\nthey were returning to their village along with Murari Lal and Mitthu Lal\n\nGadaria. When they reached near the house of Kalka Prasad at 6 p.m. the\n\naccused appellants Raj Nath, his sons Satyendra and Surendra, Gajendra,\n\nRam Kripal and Govind came there from the south western corner of the\n\nbrick wall and threatened that they will teach a lesson to Lokeshwar Nath\n\nfor purchasing the land and immediately thereafter appellant Raj Nath with\n\nhis licensed gun and rest of the appellants with their country made pistols\n\nopened fire at the prosecution party. Lalit Kumar (hereinafter referred to as\n\nthe `deceased no.1') sustained gunshot injury and died instantaneously.\n\nNarendra Nath and Shrawan Kumar sustained firearm injuries and fell down\n\nat a short distance. Lokeshwar Nath and Mahendra Nath also sustained\n\nfirearm injuries. Gun fire attracted Prem Narayan and many others to the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                         3</span>\n\fplace of the incident. When the injured were being transported to the\n\nhospital in the bullock cart by the informant, injured Narendra Nath\n\n(hereinafter referred to as deceased no.2) lost his life in the way. Shrawan\n\nKumar, Mahendra and Lokeshwar Nath were dispatched to the District\n\nHospital, Mainpuri. Informant got the FIR (Ex.Ka-7) of the said incident\n\nscribed through one Arun Kumar and lodged it at police station Kishni on\n\nthe same day at 10.30 p.m. covering a distance of 8 miles south. Lajja Ram\n\nPW-4 Constable clerk prepared the chik Fir Ex. Ka-6 and G.D. entry Ex.Ka-\n\n7 and the investigation was immediately engineered by Mahendra Prasad\n\nSingh S.O. PW-10.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">      Investigating Officer proceeded to the village Kusmara where the\n\ncorpse of Narendra was lying and there he conducted the inquest on his\n\ndead body as Ex.Ka-38. Thereafter, he came to the place of the incident in\n\nvillage Nagla Tara near the dead body of Lalit Kumar and conducted the\n\ninquest. Thereafter he conducted spot inspection and prepared site plan Ex.\n\nKa-47 collected blood stained and plain earth Ex. Ka-48. He also recovered\n\nempty cartridges (material Ex.1 to 3) from the roof of Kalka Prasad and\n\nprepared its recovery memo Ex.Ka-49. He thereafter arrested appellant Ram\n\nKripal and recovered country made pistol and three cartridges from him. On\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                        4</span>\n\f5.6.1978 he recorded the statement of the informant and thereafter in the\n\nmorning he prepared the inquest report of Narendra Nath deceased who had\n\nexpired in the hospital at 5.20 a.m. next day. Thereafter he was transferred.\n\nShrawan Kumar also lost his life after four days in the hospital because of\n\nthe sustained injuries in the incident. The post mortem examination on the\n\ndead bodies of Shrawan Kumar, Lalit Kumar, Narendra Nath and Mahendra\n\nNath was held and various gunshot injuries and ante mortem injuries were\n\nfound on their bodies.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">      The report of Forensic Science Laboratory, Lucknow, U.P. dated\n\n31.7.1978 brought out the fact the cartridges E.C.-3 was fired from\n\ncountrymade pistol marked as 1/79.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">      After investigation charge sheet was filed and charges were framed\n\nagainst all the six accused persons. Since the accused persons pleaded\n\ninnocence trial was held. PWs 1 and 2 were stated to be the eye witnesses.\n\nPlacing reliance on the evidence of the eye witnesses the trial Court found\n\nthe prosecution case to have been established and recorded conviction as\n\nnoted above.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_17\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                         5</span>\n\f      Before the High Court the stand was that there was no recovery of\n\ngun and no injury is relatable to any act purported to have been done by the\n\nappellants. The High Court did not accept this plea and held that because of\n\napplication of <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 149</a> IPC the prosecution case has been fully\n\nestablished.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_18\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">4.    In support of the appeal, learned counsel for the appellants submitted\n\nthat the Forensic Science Laboratory report clearly shows that no injury\n\ncould be inflicted with the weapon held by the appellants.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">5.    Learned counsel for the respondent-State on the other hand submitted\n\nthat four persons lost their lives because of acts of the accused persons. The\n\nrole of the present appellants has been clearly established. Therefore, the\n\nHigh Court's judgment does not suffer from any infirmity.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">6.    So far as the reliability of evidence of the eye witnesses PWs 1 and 2\n\nis concerned their evidence has been analysed in great detail by the trial\n\nCourt and the High Court. PW-2 was one of the injured persons. Therefore,\n\nthere is nothing infirm in the conclusions of the trial Court and the High\n\nCourt placing reliance on their evidence.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_22\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                          6</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">\f7.    It is to be noted that one of the deceased persons received nearly 30\n\ninjuries which is consistent with the prosecution case that the accused\n\npersons were holding country made pistols.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_24\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_25\">8.    A plea which was emphasized by the appellant relates to the question\n\nwhether <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 149</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_9\">IPC</a> has any application for fastening the constructive\n\nliability which is the sine qua non for its operation. The emphasis is on the\n\ncommon object and not on common intention.            Mere presence in an\n\nunlawful assembly cannot render a person liable unless there was a common\n\nobject and he was actuated by that common object and that object is one of\n\nthose set out in <a href=\"/doc/1542085/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 141</a>.      Where common object of an unlawful\n\nassembly is not proved, the accused persons cannot be convicted with the\n\nhelp of <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 149</a>. The crucial question to determine is whether the\n\nassembly consisted of five or more persons and whether the said persons\n\nentertained one or more of the common objects, as specified in <a href=\"/doc/1542085/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 141</a>.\n\nIt cannot be laid down as a general proposition of law that unless an overt\n\nact is proved against a person, who is alleged to be a member of unlawful\n\nassembly, it cannot be said that he is a member of an assembly. The only\n\nthing required is that he should have understood that the assembly was\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                         7</span>\n\funlawful and was likely to commit any of the acts which fall within the\n\npurview of <a href=\"/doc/1542085/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 141</a>. The word `object' means the purpose or design\n\nand, in order to make it `common', it must be shared by all. In other words,\n\nthe object should be common to the persons, who compose the assembly,\n\nthat is to say, they should all be aware of it and concur in it. A common\n\nobject may be formed by express agreement after mutual consultation, but\n\nthat is by no means necessary. It may be formed at any stage by all or a few\n\nmembers of the assembly and the other members may just join and adopt it.\n\nOnce formed, it need not continue to be the same. It may be modified or\n\naltered or abandoned at any stage.     The expression `in prosecution of\n\ncommon object' as appearing in <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 149</a> have to be strictly construed as\n\nequivalent to `in order to attain the common object'. It must be immediately\n\nconnected with the common object by virtue of the nature of the object.\n\nThere must be community of object and the object may exist only up to a\n\nparticular stage, and not thereafter. Members of an unlawful assembly may\n\nhave community of object up to certain point beyond which they may differ\n\nin their objects and the knowledge, possessed by each member of what is\n\nlikely to be committed in prosecution of their common object may vary not\n\nonly according to the information at his command, but also according to the\n\nextent to which he shares the community of object, and as a consequence of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                                        8</span>\n\fthis the effect of <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 149</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_16\">IPC</a> may be different on different members of\n\nthe same assembly.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_26\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_27\">9.    `Common object' is different from a `common intention' as it does\n\nnot require a prior concert and a common meeting of minds before the\n\nattack. It is enough if each has the same object in view and their number is\n\nfive or more and that they act as an assembly to achieve that object. The\n\n`common object' of an assembly is to be ascertained from the acts and\n\nlanguage of the members composing it, and from a consideration of all the\n\nsurrounding circumstances. It may be gathered from the course of conduct\n\nadopted by the members of the assembly. For determination of the common\n\nobject of the unlawful assembly, the conduct of each of the members of the\n\nunlawful assembly, before and at the time of attack and thereafter, the\n\nmotive for the crime, are some of the relevant considerations. What the\n\ncommon object of the unlawful assembly is at a particular stage of the\n\nincident is essentially a question of fact to be determined, keeping in view\n\nthe nature of the assembly, the arms carried by the members, and the\n\nbehaviour of the members at or near the scene of the incident. It is not\n\nnecessary under law that in all cases of unlawful assembly, with an\n\nunlawful common object, the same must be translated into action or be\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                                        9</span>\n\fsuccessful. Under the Explanation to <a href=\"/doc/1542085/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 141</a>, an assembly which was\n\nnot unlawful when it was assembled, may subsequently become unlawful.\n\nIt is not necessary that the intention or the purpose, which is necessary to\n\nrender an assembly an unlawful one comes into existence at the outset. The\n\ntime of forming an unlawful intent is not material. An assembly which, at\n\nits commencement or even for some time thereafter, is lawful, may\n\nsubsequently become unlawful. In other words it can develop during the\n\ncourse of incident at the spot co instanti.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_28\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_29\">10.   <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 149</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_19\">IPC</a> consists of two parts. The first part of the section\n\nmeans that the offence to be committed in prosecution of the common\n\nobject must be one which is committed with a view to accomplish the\n\ncommon object. In order that the offence may fall within the first part, the\n\noffence must be connected immediately with the common object of the\n\nunlawful assembly of which the accused was member. Even if the offence\n\ncommitted is not in direct prosecution of the common object of the\n\nassembly, it may yet fall under <a href=\"/doc/1542085/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 141</a>, if it can be held that the offence\n\nwas such as the members knew was likely to be committed and this is what\n\nis required in the second part of the section. The purpose for which the\n\nmembers of the assembly set out or desired to achieve is the object. If the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                           10</span>\n\fobject desired by all the members is the same, the knowledge that is the\n\nobject which is being pursued is shared by all the members and they are in\n\ngeneral agreement as to how it is to be achieved and that is now the\n\ncommon object of the assembly. An object is entertained in the human\n\nmind, and it being merely a mental attitude, no direct evidence can be\n\navailable and, like intention, has generally to be gathered from the act\n\nwhich the person commits and the result therefrom. Though no hard and\n\nfast rule can be laid down under the circumstances from which the common\n\nobject can be called out, it may reasonably be collected from the nature of\n\nthe assembly, arms it carries and behaviour at or before or after the scene of\n\nincident. The word `knew' used in the second branch of the section implies\n\nsomething more than a possibility and it cannot be made to bear the sense of\n\n`might have been known'. Positive knowledge is necessary. When an\n\noffence is committed in prosecution of the common object, it would\n\ngenerally be an offence which the members of the unlawful assembly knew\n\nwas likely to be committed in prosecution of the common object. That,\n\nhowever, does not make the converse proposition true; there may be cases\n\nwhich would come within the second part but not within the first part. The\n\ndistinction between the two parts of <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 149</a> cannot be ignored or\n\nobliterated. In every case it would be an issue to be determined, whether\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                                                          11</span>\n\fthe offence committed falls within the first part or it was an offence such as\n\nthe members of the assembly knew to be likely to be committed in\n\nprosecution of the common object and falls within the second part.\n\nHowever, there may be cases which would be within first part, but offences\n\ncommitted in prosecution of the common object would be generally, if not\n\nalways, be within the second part, namely, offences which the parties knew\n\nto be likely committed in the prosecution of the common object.

His\n\n    representation for permanent absorption was rejected. Aggrieved by and dissatisfied\n\n    therewith, he filed original application before the Central Administrative Tribunal.\n\n    By a judgment and order dated 31.8.2004, the said application was allowed.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                           2</span>\n\nAppellant herein was directed to give effect to the order of absorption, aggrieved\n\nwhereby it filed a writ petition which by reason of the impugned judgment has been\n\ndismissed by the High Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">         Before the High Court, reliance was placed on a purported Memo dated\n\n17.4.2003 issued by the SIB, in terms whereof those who had only one year's service\n\nleft for retirement, were not to be considered for absorption, inter alia on the\n\npremise that the said Memo will have prospective effect. The contention of the\n\nappellant was rejected by the High Court, stating:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">       \"But this communication, as already observed by us, is not based on\n       legal position as available in the Rules. The very contention of the\n       Department is that the personnel shown in the letter dated 19.7.2001\n       are entitled for absorption in the Central Services and consequent on\n       their absorption, their lien in the parent department will be\n       terminated. It is also on record that number of police personnel were\n       absorbed in the IB and also continuing in the IB Service. In view of\n       this, it is not understood as to how the Government could refuse the\n       same benefit in respect of the 1st respondent.\"</blockquote><p id=\"p_7\">\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">         Mr. Radhakrishnan, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nappellant would submit that the first respondent having no right to be absorbed in\n\nthe appellant services, the impugned judgment is wholly unsustainable.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">         Mr. Chowdhary, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the State of\n\nAndhra Pradesh, supported the contention of the appellants.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                           3</span>\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">         Nothing has been shown either before the Tribunal or before the High\n\nCourt by or on behalf of the first respondent herein that he had a statutory right to\n\nbe absorbed in the appellants' services.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">         In this case, the State of Andhra Pradesh, which was the lending authority,\n\ndid not accede to the prayer of the first respondent for permanent absorption in the\n\nservices of the SIB. The first respondent while on deputation, was holding lien in the\n\nState of Andhra Pradesh. The employer, therefore, had a right to give or withhold\n\nits consent for permanent absorption of its employee.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">         Furthermore, in absence of any statutory rules, an employee does not have\n\nany legal right to be absorbed in the services. It is so held in <a href=\"/doc/527418/\" id=\"a_1\">Kunal Nanda vs. Union\n\nof India and Anr</a>. [2000 (5) SCC 362], in the following terms:\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">       \"On the legal submissions also made there are no merits whatsoever.\n       It is well settled that unless the claim of the deputationist for a\n       permanent absorption in the department where he works on\n       deputation is based upon any statutory rule, regulation or order\n       having the force of law, a deputationist cannot assert and succeed in\n       any such claim for absorption.          The basic principle underlying\n       deputation itself is that the person concerned can always and at any\n       time be repatriated to his parent department to serve in his\n       substantive position therein at the instance of either of the\n       departments and there is no vested right in such a person to continue\n       for long on deputation or get absorbed in the department to which he\n       had gone on deputation. The reference to the decision reported in\n       <a href=\"/doc/656676/\" id=\"a_2\">Rameshwar Prasad v. M.D., U.P. Rajkiya Nirman Nigam Ltd</a> is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                           4</span>\n\n       inappropriate since the consideration therein was in the light of the\n       statutory Rules for absorption and the scope of those Rules. The\n       claim that he need not be a graduate for absorption and being a\n       service candidate, on completing service of 10 years he is exempt from\n       the requirement of possessing a degree needs mention, only to be\n       rejected.    The stand of the respondent Department that the\n       absorption of a deputationist being one against the direct quota, the\n       possession of basic educational qualification prescribed for direct\n       recruitment i.e. a degree is a must and essential and that there could\n       be no comparison of the claim of such a person with one to be dealt\n       with on promotion of a candidate who is already in service in that\n       Department is well merited and deserves to be sustained and we see\n       no infirmity whatsoever in the said claim.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_14\">See also Mahesh Kumar K.

Two persons i.e. Khemanand and the present appellant filed the\n\nappeal before the High Court which was dismissed by the impugned\n\njudgment.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">3.    Background facts in a nutshell are as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">      On 6.2.1985 the prosecutrix was sent by her mother to purchase rice\n\nfrom cheap grain shop. The prosecutrix waited there for sometimes in front\n\nof the shop. Ultimately, the prosecutrix returned to her home without\n\npurchasing rice. When her mother saw her without rice and coming late at\n\nhome, she scolded and admonished her. The prosecutrix was again sent to\n\nthe cheap grain shop and she again found it closed. When the prosecutrix\n\nwas in a sad and remorseful mood, the accused Basant Ballabh (who died\n\nduring the pendency of appeal) who was known to the prosecutrix came\n\nover there and inquired from her the reason for her remorse. The accused\n\nBasant Ballabh started to console her by saying that her mother was\n\nadmonishing her everyday and suggested that they should run away and\n\nmarry at Purnagiri temple. The accused, Basant Ballabh also told her that\n\nhis maternal uncle has a factory where he would get an employment and\n\nearn money and live comfortably. The accused Basant Ballabh took the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                    2</span>\n\fprosecutrix to his room where they stayed throughout the night. The accused\n\nBasant Ballabh promised her to marry on the next day in Purnagiri Temple.\n\nDuring the intervening night of 6th/7th February, 1985, accused Basant\n\nBallabh committed rape on the prosecutrix thrice in the night. On the next\n\nday, the prosecutrix along with accused Basant Ballabh proceeded to the\n\nbus station Champawat The accused Basant Ballabh asked the prosecutrix\n\nto go on foot 1 k.m. ahead from Champawat towards Tanakpur side and\n\nwait for him near the Deodar tree from where he would pick her up in the\n\nbus. Following the said instructions, the prosecutrix proceeded towards the\n\nDeodar tree on foot which is ahead of Champawat, from where she was\n\ntaken in the bus by the accused Basant Ballahh and Trilok Singh (who\n\nturned Approver) who had also joined hands with accused Basant Ballabh.\n\nThey all proceeded towards Tanakpur and got down little before Tanakpur\n\nfrom where they proceeded on foot and reached on Tanakpur-Bareilly road.\n\nThey again boarded a bus going towards the side of Bareilly. The\n\nprosecutrix became anxious and inquired as to where they were going. In\n\nreply, the accused told her that they would first purchase the articles\n\nrequired to perform marriage from Pilibhit and then would go to the temple.\n\nWhen they reached at Pilibhit, the prosecutrix was taken to a liquor shop\n\nwhere the accused Khemanand used to work as a Salesman. The accused\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                   3</span>\n\fKhemanand was also having an accommodation there. The accused Basant\n\nBallabh, Trilok Singh and Khemanand took the prosecutrix inside the room\n\nof accused Khemanand where the accused persons consumed liquor. After\n\nfinishing the drinks, Trilok Singh and Basant Ballabh slept on one cot,\n\nwhile Khemanand and the prosecutrix took separate cots. After sometimes,\n\naccused Khemanand went upto the cot of the prosecutrix and tried to molest\n\nher. The prosecutrix resisted his attempts and complained against accused\n\nKhemanand to Basant Ballabh. Accused Basant Ballabh instead of helping\n\nher, asked her to fulfill the desire of the accused Khemanand. Accused\n\nKhemanand subjected the prosecutrix to sexual intercourse forcibly. On\n\n9.2.1985 the prosecutrix was taken to village Tikri where distantly related\n\nsister of Trilok Singh was residing so that they may not be apprehended by\n\nthe police. Accused Triok Singh and Basant Ballabh went outside the\n\nvillage to ascertain whether any report against them has been made or not.\n\nThey came to know that a report has been lodged in the police station. The\n\naccused brought the prosecutrix from village Tikri to Tanakpur. At Pilibhit,\n\naccused Basant Ballabh got down and asked Trilok Singh to send the\n\nprosecutrix to Champawat. Trilok Singh brought the prosecutrix to\n\nTanakpur. Thereafter, accused Trilok Singh found truck No.USZ-4480 with\n\nits driver accused Mohan Chand near a pump at Tanakpur. Accused Trilok\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                    4</span>\n\fSingh told accused Mohan Chand that the prosecutrix was a student of class\n\nIX and her school is to open the next day, therefore, she may be taken in the\n\ntruck. Accused Trilok Singh also paid fare and instructed accused Mohan\n\nChand that the prosecutrix be made to get down 1 k.m. before Champawat.\n\nThereafter accused Mohan Chand also committed rape upon her. When the\n\ntruck moved a little forward, it stopped and an unknown person who was\n\nsitting by the side of the driver also went to the prosecutrix and committed\n\nrape upon the prosecutrix. Accused Mohan Chand made the prosecutrix to\n\nget down 1 k.m. before Champawat. She covered the distance on foot and\n\nwent straight to the house of accused Basant Ballabh. A written report\n\nEx.Ka.7 was lodged by Girish Chandra Paneru on 07.02.1985 before the\n\nPatti Patwari Talla Charao alleging therein that his niece, i.e. the prosecutrix\n\nis not traceable since 06.02.1985 and that he has gathered the information\n\nthat the accused Basant Ballabh has taken her away from Champawat\n\ntowards Tanakpur. On the basis of FIR, the Chick FIR Ex.Ka.8 was\n\nprepared. Patti Patwari Devi Datt (PW7) investigated the case. He recorded\n\nthe statement of the prosecutrix under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 161</a> of the Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure, 1973 (in short the `Code') on 10.02.1985. During the course of\n\ninvestigation, the prosecutrix gave a written report Ex.Ka.3 and disclosed\n\nthat she has been raped by the accused persons. The Investigating Officer\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                     5</span>\n\fsent the prosecutrix for medical examination in order to ascertain her age\n\nand whether she was subjected to sexual intercourse or not. The\n\ninvestigating officer after completing the necessary formalities of the\n\ninvestigation submitted the charge sheet Ex.Ka.13 before the Court.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">      After completion of investigation charge sheet was filed and since the\n\naccused persons pleaded innocence trial was held. Prem Lata Tiwari (PW-2)\n\nwas the principal of the school where the prosecutrix was studying. PW-4\n\nwas the prosecutrix. Trilok Singh (PW-5) was the accused but later on was\n\nmade an approver. The trial Court found the evidence to be sufficient and\n\nconvicted the accused persons.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">      In appeal, the basic stand taken was that at the first instance the name\n\nof the appellant was not stated and, therefore, there was false implication\n\nand the conviction should not have been recorded as the evidence is not\n\nsufficient to establish the accusations. The High Court did not find any\n\nsubstance in the plea and dismissed the appeal.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">4.

It is to be noted that the prosecutrix did not know the name of the\n\naccused and, therefore, there was necessity for Test Identification Parade.\n\nThe evidence of the prosecutrix is clear and cogent. In the instant case the\n\naccused is not personally known to the victim and therefore stating his name\n\nin the FIR did not arise. However, she has categorically stated that the rape\n\nwas committed on her by the truck driver. After the arrest of the accused he\n\nwas put in TI Parade and the victim had correctly identified him. That being\n\nso, the judgments of the trial Court and the High Court do not suffer from\n\nany infirmity to warrant interference.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_18\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">7.

While issuing notice to\n\n   the respondents on 11th August, 2008, it was directed that\n\n                                                                ..2/-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                 :2:</span>\n\n\n\n   respondent No. 2 (Husband) shall remain present in Court on the next date of\n\n   hearing. When the matter was taken up for consideration on 29th September,\n\f2008, it was felt that it would be appropriate if the case is referred to the\n\nMediation Centre at Delhi High Court and an attempt is made to resolve the\n\ndisputes between the parties.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">          Pursuant to the said order, the parties appeared before the learned\n\nMediator, who interacted with the parties on several dates and, ultimately, vide\n\nher report dated 11th December, 2008, apprised this Court about the progress in\n\nthose proceedings. it was reported that though substantial progress had been\n\nmade in settlement of disputes between the parties, there were still some areas of\n\nconcern which were yet to be addressed. Nevertheless, as per the report, a draft\n\nsettlement agreement had been circulated to the parties and their counsel for their\n\nconsideration.   Ultimately, the learned Mediator filed her final report on 5th\n\nJanuary, 2009, reporting that even though a final settlement between the parties\n\nhad been arrived at, but the parties had certain apprehensions on the settlement\n\nin regard to the visitation rights to the father which could be cleared with the\n\nintervention of this Court.      An unsigned copy of the settlement agreement\n\nbetween the parties was filed with the report.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">                                                           ...3/-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                :3:</span>\n\n          On 7th January, 2009, when the matter came up for consideration of the\n\nfinal report submitted by the learned Mediator, learned counsel for the parties\n\nstated that the terms of settlement, incorporated in the draft settlement\n\nagreement, dated December 28, 2008, were acceptable to their respective clients,\n\nand they would ensure that all these are adhered to in letter and spirit. Learned\n\ncounsel sought time to file a proper affidavit/document setting out the consent\n\nterms so that the matter could be disposed of in terms thereof, which has been\n\fdone.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">          We have heard learned counsel for the parties.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n          In view of the fact that an amicable settlement has been arrived at\n\nbetween the contesting parties, it is unnecessary to advert to the facts giving rise\n\nto the filing of the present petition. What needs to be noted is that with the\n\nuntiring efforts of the learned Mediator, the wife (petitioner No.1) and the\n\nhusband (respondent No.2) have resolved their differences amicably and have\n\nfiled a signed application praying that this Court may be pleased to record the\n\nsettlement and dissolve the marriage between them by a decree of divorce by\n\nmutual consent; the period under Section 13 B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955\n\n(hereinafter for short `the Act) be dispensed with and\n\n                                                            ...4/-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                              :4:</span>\n\nvarious cases initiated by them against each other may be quashed. The\n\napplication is signed by both the said parties and is supported by their affidavits.\n\nBoth the parties, are present in Court and have been identified by their counsel.\n\nThey re-affirm that they have entered into the settlement without any pressure or\n\ncoercion from any side.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">          We have perused the terms of the settlement. It seems to be bona fide\n\nand therefore there is no impediment in accepting the same to put an end to\n\nacrimonious disputes between the parties.\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">\f                    Accordingly, in exercise of our jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 142</a> of the\n\n          Constitution we allow I.A.

We do not find any reason to interfere in the judgment passed by the National\n\nConsumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi (for short, `the National\n\nCommission'). It seems that the National Commission has rejected the matter on the\n\nbasis of their earlier view holding the concerned clause 7 in the policy to be void after\n\nthe interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act, 1872 ( for short `the Act').\n\n</p><p id=\"p_2\">2.        Learned counsel appearing for the appellant,              Shri Mehra, tried to\n\npersuade us on the basis of few cases that the view taken on the interpretation of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 28</a> is not correct. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent,\n\nhowever, points out that there is no necessity to consider <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 28</a> as the complaint\n\nbefore the consumer forum was filed well within the limitation indicated by the\n\nrepudiation clause in the policy. The clause is as under :\n\n</p><p id=\"p_3\">                                                                                     ..2/-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">\n\n\nC.A. 7398/2002..contd...\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                             :2:</span>\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">                           \"It is also hereby further expressly agreed and\n\f              declared that if the company shall disclaim liability to the\n              insured for any claim hereunder and such claim shall not, within\n              3 calendar months from the date of such disclaimer have been\n              made the subject matter of a suit in a court of law, then the\n              claim shall for all purposes be deemed to have been abandoned\n              and shall not thereafter be recoverable hereunder.\"\n\nAccording to the learned counsel there is enough material to suggest that even after the\n\nfirst repudiation by the appellant when the matters were taken up again by the\n\nrespondent through the representations dated 12.4.1993, 12.5.1993 and 4.8.1993, the\n\nappellant- Insurance Company suggested by its reply dated August 06, 1993 that the\n\nmatter of repudiation was being taken under fresh consideration. It is tried to be\n\nsuggested before us by Shri Mehra that the first repudiation was confirmed by reply\n\ndated 28.2.1994. However, we find on record that there is a legal notice served on the\n\nappellant company, in answer to which again the appellant- insurance company\n\npromised to take up the matter for further consideration. As if that is not sufficient,\n\nour attention is invited to the affidavit of one Mr. U.S. Asthana dated 16.3.1996, which\n\nis a reply affidavit to the complaint before the District Consumer Forum. In that\n\naffidavit, in\n\n                                                                                    ..3/-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">\n\n\nC.A. 7398/2002....contd...\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                            :3:</span>\n\nparagraph 9, it is reiterated as under :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                      \" ...accordingly after thorough study the final decision as\n             per advice of the Head Office of the oppo. party and the same was\n             conveyed to the complainant vide letter dated 28.7.94.\"\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"p_9\">3.         This leaves us in no doubt that the final decision about the repudiation was\n\fconveyed on 28.7.1994 and till then, the appellant kept on dangling a carrot of hope\n\nbefore the respondent herein that the matter regarding repudiation of claim was being\n\nconsidered afresh.      If that is so, then the complaint made on 6.8.1994 would be\n\nwithin three months of 28.7.94 which was a final answer and there would be no\n\nquestion of the general condition No. 7 coming into play. Therefore, viewing from this\n\nangle, the order of the National Commission need not be interfered with.          We,\n\ntherefore, find it not necessary to go into the question of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 28</a> of the Contract\n\nAct. Be that as it may, we find that the matter has no bearing, no merit and the\n\nappeal is, accordingly, dismissed.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">                          ...................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">                                                  [ V.S.

He claimed Rs.13,000/- as cost of\ntreatment, Rs.7,500/- towards transportation charges, Rs.4,32,000/- as loss of income\ndue to voluntary retirement, Rs.1,44,000/- which he would have earned by continuing\nin service, Rs.2,00,000/- by way of damages for pain and suffering, Rs.5,00,000/- by\nway of damages for mental agony to himself, wife and children and Rs.1,00,000/- as\ndamages for disfigurement.      Respondent Nos.1 to 3 contested the complaint by\nasserting that it was not a case of medical negligence and that the claim made by the\nappellant was exorbitant.\n</p><p id=\"p_3\">                                                                                 ....2/-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                          -2-</span>\n<p id=\"p_4\">           The State Commission, after considering the pleadings of the parties and\nrecord produced by them, held that the doctors who performed the surgery are not\nguilty of negligence and the loss of vision may have been caused due to infection. In\nthe opinion of the State Commission, the hospital authorities may have been negligent\nin maintaining hygiene and this may have led to infection. The State Commission\nthen observed that the complainant has not been able to prove that he suffered any\npecuniary loss and awarded Rs.40,000/- as compensation, Rs.5,000/- towards\nexpenditure and Rs.1,000/- by way of cost. On appeal, the National Consumer\nDisputes Redressal Commission (for short, the National Commission') criticized the\nobservation of the State Commission that the complainant could not prove that he\nhad suffered pecuniary loss and observed that loss of one eye for the entire life was an\nextremely serious matter which deserved a more sensitive approach by the State\nCommission. The National Commission held that the appellant has suffered due to\ngross negligence of the hospital authorities and enhanced the compensation from\nRs.40,000/- to Rs.1,00,000/- and cost of treatment from Rs.5,000/- to Rs.13,000/-. The\nNational Commission directed that the amount be paid to the appellant-complainant\nwithin six weeks, failing which he shall be entitled to interest at the rate of nine per\ncent per annum. Feeling dissatisfied, the complainant has filed this appeal by special\nleave.\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">           We have heard learned counsel for the parties. Undisputedly, the appellant\nsuffered loss of vision in one eye due to negligence of the hospital authorities to\nmaintain\n                                                                                   ....3/-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                          -3-</span>\n<p id=\"p_6\">hygiene, which led to infection. This finding of the State Commission was not\nchallenged by the respondents before the National Commission and, therefore, the\nsame will be deemed to have become final. The disability suffered by the appellant is\nof permanent nature. The appellant, who was in government service, was forced to\ntake pre-mature retirement nine years before the date of superannuation apparently\nbecause he could not effectively discharge his duties. At the relevant time his salary\nwas Rs.6400/-. On retirement, the appellant was given pension at the rate of Rs.2500/-\nper month. Thus, the difference in salary and retirement benefit was Rs.3,900/- per\nmonth. After taking into consideration the expected increase in salary, the appellant\nclaimed compensation of Rs.4,32,000/- in lieu of the loss of salary. The respondents\nhave not disputed the fact that the appellant had sought voluntary retirement and\nconsequently, he suffered pecuniary loss. The State Commission awarded paltry\namount of Rs.40,000/- without even considering the appellant's plea that he was\nforced to seek voluntary retirement nine years before the age of superannuation. The\nNational Commission did enhance the compensation to Rs.1,00,000/- but without\nadverting to the pecuniary loss suffered by the appellant due to pre-mature\nretirement from service. In our considered view, the monetary loss suffered by the\nappellant furnishes valid basis for award of enhanced compensation to him.\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">           Accordingly, the appeal is allowed in part with costs, impugned order is\nmodified and the management of Cochin Hospital is directed to pay enhanced\ncompensation of Rs.4,32,000/- to the appellant in addition to enhanced cost of\ntreatment i.e. Rs.13,000/-. The appellant shall get cost of litigation which is assessed\nat Rs.50,000/-. The entire\n                                                                                   ....4/-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                           -4-</span>\n<p id=\"p_8\">amount shall be paid to the appellant within three months from the date of receipt of\ncopy of this order, failing which the hospital authority shall be liable to pay interest at\nthe rate of twelve per cent per annum with effect from the date of this order till the\ndate of actual payment. The Management shall be entitled to deduct the amount, if\nany, already paid to the appellant pursuant to the orders of the State and/or National\nCommission.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_9\">                                                                           ......................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">                                                 [B.N.

Learned MACT, Karkardooma Court, Delhi              fixed the\n\n     amount payable as compensation to be Rs. 3,00,598/-. But deducting 40% for the\n\n     alleged contributory negligence of the claimant, ultimately the amount payable by the\n\n     present appellant to the claimant was fixed at Rs. 1,80,358/- (approximately). In\n\n     appeal filed by the claimant, the High Court by the impugned judgment held that the\n\n     reasons indicated by the MACT for making deduction on\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                   -2-</span>\n\faccount of alleged contributory negligence were not sufficient for the purpose of\n\nmaking a deduction.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">             In the present appeal, it is stated by learned counsel for the appellant-\n\nCorporation that MACT categorically indicated reasons as to why it held that there\n\nwas contributory negligence on the part of the respondent leading to the accident in\n\nquestion.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">            There is no appearance on behalf of the respondent in spite of service of\n\nnotice.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">            We find that the High court has discarded the view indicated by MACT on\n\nthe ground that the evidence of the driver who was examined shows about the\n\ncontributory negligence cannot be given any preference over the evidence of the\n\nclaimant. That was not the only ground on which MACT had directed deduction for\n\ncontributory negligence.     It was observed that though the place of accident was\n\nindicated, the site plan did not plan other relevant details.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">            In the peculiar facts of the case, we are of the view that there was\n\ncontributory negligence on the part of the claimant. Considering the nature of the\n\naccident we held that the liability of the Corporation shall be Rs. 2,35,000/- with\n\ninterest @ 6% from the date of accident. It is stated that nearly Rs. 2,22,000/- had\n\nalready been deposited.

Prosecution version in a nutshell is as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">      The incident resulting in the death of Sukhai and causing injuries to\n\nSabhajit and Laljit occurred on 26.12.1981 in Village Larpur Saheb Ali\n\nsituated within the limits of P.S. Didarganj, District Azamgarh. First\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                    2</span>\n\fInformation Report was lodged on 26.12.1981 by Ramjit S/o Sukhai Yadav\n\nR/o Village Larpur Saheb Ali. The case of prosecution as appearing from\n\nthe F.I.R. in brief is that the chak of the complainant Ramjit was situated in\n\nnorthern side near to the house of Mangaru S/o Munne Lal Yadav. On\n\n26.12.1981 Sabhajit, brother of the complainant, along with one Dhodhai\n\n(PW-2) was harrowing his wheat field. At about 4.30 p.m. the bull of the\n\naccused Mangaru entered into another field of the complainant and started\n\ngrazing and damaging the wheat crop. Sabhajit seeing the bull grazing and\n\ndamaging his wheat crop, called Ramjit son of Mangaru and asked him to\n\ntake out his bull. Sabhajit complained also to Ramjit that their cattle always\n\ntrespass in his field and damage the grown standing crop. Thereupon,\n\nRamjit hurling abuses to Sabhajit went inside his house and immediately\n\nthereafter the accused Mangaru and Rajdev having lathies in their hands and\n\nRam Bachan, Ram Achal and Ramjit armed with knife, bhala and gandasi\n\nrespectively came there and they all began to assault Sabhajit. When on\n\nhearing hue and cry, the complainant Ramjit, his father Sukhai and brother\n\nLaljit rushed to save Sabhajit, the accused persons assaulted Sukhai and\n\nLaljit also. Behind the complainant, his cousin Indrajit, witnesses Sabhajit\n\nS/o Bahadur Yadav and Sita S/o Madhar Yadav of his village and Ram\n\nNarayan Singh S/o Hub Raj Singh of village Larpur Jhokhu as well as his\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                     3</span>\n\fmaternal uncle Sudarshan of village Gilwara also reached there. On being\n\nchallenged by these persons, the accused went away after causing injuries to\n\nSabhajit, Laljit and Sukhai. The complainant Ramjit witnessed the incident\n\nstanding at some distance. Sukhai having sustained serious injuries fell\n\ndown in the field and died instantaneously. Sabhajit and Laljit also\n\nsustained serious injuries due to which they were carried to Government\n\nHospital, Phulpur for treatment. The complainant with the help of Banarsi,\n\nJeetu, Adhin and Keesa carried the dead body of his father to P.S.\n\nDeedarganj and handed over written report there which was scribed by\n\nAbhai Raj (P.W.4).\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">      On the basis of written report the then Head Moharir, Bal Govind\n\nTiwari prepared chik F.I.R. and registered a case on 26.12.1981 at 6.30 p.m.\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_3\">Sections 147</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_4\">148</a>, <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_5\">149</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_6\">323</a>, <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_7\">324</a>, <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_8\">307</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_9\">302</a> I.P.C. at Crime\n\nNo.106/1981 against Mangaru, Ramjit, Ram Achal, Ram Bachan and\n\nRajdev and made entry in G.D. vide Ext.Ka-3.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">      The inquest proceeding on the dead body of Sukhai was conducted on\n\n27.12.1981 by S.I.

Sinha (PW-7)\n\nwho prepared post mortem report. Various injuries were found on the\n\nperson of the deceased. Investigation of the case was entrusted to S.I. Lat\n\nBuksh Singh (PW-5) who recorded the statement of the witnesses and after\n\nmaking spot inspection at the instance of the complainant Ramjit prepared\n\nsite plan. Blood stained and sample earth were collected from two places in\n\nthe field of occurrence and one knife was also recovered from the place\n\nwhere the dead body of the Sukhai was stated to be lying in the field and\n\nfard Ext.Ka.8 and KA-9 were prepared in this regard. Thereafter, blood\n\nstained lathi, gandasi and bhala were recovered from the well of accused\n\nMangaru at the instance of witnesses and fard was prepared.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">      After completion of investigation charge sheet was filed. Since the\n\naccused persons pleaded innocence trial was held. Nine witnesses were\n\nexamined to further the prosecution version. Sabhajit Yadav (PW-1) and\n\nLaljit (PW-3) were injured witnesses. Similarly, Dhodhai (PW-2) was also\n\nan eye witness.

It is submitted by learned counsel for the State that this cannot be\n\nstated to be a case of sudden quarrel because the accused persons after the\n\nquarrel went inside and came back with arms. In the instant case though the\n\nwitnesses stated that after initial exchange of hot words and quarrel the\n\naccused persons went inside and came back, it is to be noted that they have\n\nfairly accepted that while the exchange of hot words, quarrel was continuing\n\nand immediately i.e. in less than two and three minutes they came back.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                    6</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">\f7.

Were\nactionable claims etc., not otherwise includible in the definition of `goods'\nthere was no need for excluding them. In other words, actionable claims\nare `goods' but not for the purpose of the <a href=\"/doc/1645178/\" id=\"a_2\">Sales Tax Act</a>s and but for this\nstatutory exclusion, an actionable claim would be `goods' or the subject\nmatter of ownership.     Consequently, an actionable claim is movable\nproperty and `goods' in the wider sense of the term but a sale of an\nactionable claim would not be subject to the sales tax law.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">          xxxxxx              xxxxxx              xxxxx\n\n\n          A lottery ticket has no value in itself. It is a mere piece of\npaper. Its value lies in the fact that it represents a chance or a right to a\nconditional benefit of winning a prize of a greater value than the\nconsideration paid for the transfer of that chance. It is nothing more\nthan a token or evidence of this right. The Court in H.Anraj, as we have\nseen, held that a lottery ticket is a slip of paper of memoranda evidencing\nthe transfer of certain rights. We agree.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">          xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                     -3-</span>\n\n\n          The question is, what is this right which the ticket represents?\n</blockquote><p id=\"p_6\">There can be no doubt that on purchasing a lottery ticket, the purchaser\n\f          would have a claim to a conditional interest in the prize money which is\n          not in the purchaser's possession. The right would fall squarely within\n          the definition of an actionable claim and would therefore be excluded\n          from the definition of `goods' under the <a href=\"/doc/651105/\" id=\"a_3\">Sale of Goods Act</a> and the Sales\n          tax statutes.\"\n</p>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">                                ................ .J.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">                                                   (Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT)\n\n\n\n                                       ...................J.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"p_7\">                      (ASOK KUMAR GANGULY)\nNew Delhi,\nJanuary 23, 2009.\n</p>\f","tid":1160487,"showurl":true,"citeList":[{"tid":651105,"url":null,"title":"The Sale of Goods Act, 1930"},{"tid":1645178,"url":null,"title":"the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956"},{"tid":1118022,"url":"http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgst.aspx?filename=30231","title":"Sunrise Associates vs Govt.

Similarly, assessee contends that\n\nthere a conceptual difference between current depreciation and carried forward\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                           2</span>\n\funabsorbed depreciation. It is the case of the assessee that Explanation (a) to Section\n\n158BB does not rule out current year's losses or current year's depreciation; it only\n\nrules out the brought forward losses or unabsorbed depreciation under Section 32(2).\n\nAccording to the appellant, this difference is lost sight of by the Settlement\n\nCommission in its impugned judgment.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">         In order to answer the contention raised on behalf of the assessee, one has\n\nto examine the scheme of Section 158BB of the 1961 Act. It is not in controversy that\n\nChapter XIV-B constitutes a Code by itself.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">         In this case, we are concerned with the computation of \"undisclosed\n\nincome\" under Section 158BB of the Act. Section 158BB, inter alia, states that\n\nundisclosed income of the block period shall be \"the aggregate of the total income of\n\nthe previous years falling within the block period\" computed in accordance with the\n\nprovisions of Chapter IV. \"Total income\" is defined in Section 2(45) to mean the\n\ntotal amount of income referred to in section 5, computed in the manner laid down in\n\nthe Act. In other words, Chapter XIV does not rule out Chapter IV of the Act in the\n\nmatter of computation of undisclosed income under Chapter XIV-B. It may be\n\nmentioned that ordinarily, in the case of regular assessment, the unit of assessment is\n\none year consisting of twelve months whereas in the case of block assessment, the unit\n\nof assessment consists of ten previous years and the period upto the date of the\n\nsearch. Section 158BB provides for aggregation of income/loss of each previous year\n\ncomprised in the block period. The block period assessment under Chapter XIV-B is\n\nin addition to regular assessment.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">         Analysing Section 158BB(4) read with Explanation (a) thereto, one finds\n\nthat only brought forward losses of the past years under Chapter VI and unabsorbed\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                           3</span>\n\fdepreciation under Section 32(2) are to be excluded while aggregating the total\n\nincome or loss of each previous year in the block period but set off of the loss suffered\n\nin any of the previous year in the block period against the income assessed in other\n\nprevious years in the block period is not prohibited. In our view, the Settlement\n\nCommission had erred in disallowing the application of the assessee for set off of\n\ninter se losses and depreciation accruing in any of the previous year in the block\n\nperiod against the income returned/assessed in any other previous year in the block\n\nperiod.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">          For the aforestated reasons, we set aside the impugned judgment of the\n\nHigh Court as well as the decision of the Settlement Commission and we remit the\n\nmatter to the Settlement Commission for fresh computation of the undisclosed income\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1971671/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 158BB</a> of the Income Tax Act, 1961 for the block period in question.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">          Civil Appeals are allowed accordingly, with no order as to costs.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">                                    ...................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">                                                       (S.H.

The facts leading to filing of this appeal are: one Smt. Sonia\n\nresident of village Chhibab was married in   Zari with Mengi. Only two\n\ndaughters namely Bhagwania and Maiki were born out of the wedlock.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                  2</span>\n\n\nThe appellants herein Subba and Sudish are the sons of Maiki. After\n\nthe demise of Mengi, Sonia inherited the property in question from the\n\ndeceased Mengi. It is alleged that after the death of Mengi one Teni\n\nwho was working for Sonia as labourer developed illicit relations with\n\nSonia as a result one son Debiya respondent herein was born. Be it\n\nnoted, as per the version of the appellants Debiya is not the legal son\n\nof Sonia and Mengi, therefore, he could not be the legal heir to\n\nsucceed the inherited property of Sonia. Teni died in the year 1956.\n\nSonia died in April, 1977. In the year 1978, the appellants herein filed\n\nobjections under the provisions of U.P. Consolidation Holdings Act,\n\n1953 before the Assistant Consolidation Officer, Zari, District Banda\n\nfor declaration as legal heirs of Sonia and their names to be recorded\n\nin the revenue records in place of Sonia.        Deviya also filed his\n\nobjections whereunder he claimed that the disputed property was\n\nself-acquired property of his father Teni. The Consolidation Officer\n\nvide order dated 7.7.1980 declared Debiya to be the sole legal heir of\n\nSonia and Teni. The appellants herein being aggrieved by the said\n\norder filed Appeal No. 1838 before the Assistant Settlement Officer\n\nConsolidation, Jhansi Camp-Banda which was dismissed vide order\n\ndated 25.9.1980. Thereafter the appellants filed revision no. 1656\n\nwhich was allowed by the Assistant Director Consolidation vide order\n\ndated 19.4.1985 setting aside the judgment and order of Settlement\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                 3</span>\n\n\nOfficer Consolidation and directed the names of the appellants to be\n\nrecorded in respect of the said property left behind by Sonia. Being\n\naggrieved by the revisional order Debiya-the respondent herein filed\n\nwrit petition before the High Court. The High Court while allowing the\n\nwrit petition quashed the judgment and order of Assistant Director\n\nConsolidation and restored the order of Consolidation Officer and\n\nSettlement Officer Consolidation. Hence this appeal.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">4.    We have elaborately heard the learned counsel for the parties\n\nand perused the impugned judgment and the material made available\n\non record.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">5.    The High Court mainly relied upon the admission stated to have\n\nbeen made by the appellants herein in their objections to the effect\n\nthat the respondent was born out of \"illegal relationship of Teni and\n\nSonia.\" The whole conclusion of the High Court and its decision to\n\nreverse the order of the Revisional Court is based upon the said\n\nadmission.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">6.    The question that arises for consideration in this appeal is as to\n\nwhether the High Court committed any error apparent on the face of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                  4</span>\n\n\nthe record in coming to such conclusion that the respondent herein\n\nwas born out of the relationship between Teni and Sonia? Secondly,\n\nwhether the evidence available on record supports the conclusion\n\nreached by the High Court in a proceeding under <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 227</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India? Thirdly, whether is there any such admission at\n\nall made by the appellants herein in their objections?\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">7.    The evidence adduced on behalf of the respondent herein is not\n\nclear as regards the birth of Debiya out of the relationship between\n\nTeni and Sonia. No doubt the entries in the voter list of the year 1959\n\nas well as 1975 the name of the respondent was shown as son of Teni\n\nbut that evidence of respondent itself is not of any assistance to arrive\n\nat any conclusion that he was born out of the relationship between\n\nTeni and Sonia. He expressed his ignorance as to when and where\n\nTeni died.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">8.    So far as the evidence of the appellants is concerned, the\n\nwitnesses examined on their behalf in clear and categorical terms\n\nstated that Teni did not belong to their village Zari but he came to that\n\nvillage in search of work along with the respondent and he was\n\nengaged to work as labourer by Sonia.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                 5</span><p id=\"p_15\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">9.    There is no dispute whatsoever that entries in the revenue\n\nrecords before the commencement of lis between the parties were in\n\nthe name of Sonia and Mengi in respect of the property in question. It\n\nis also not in dispute that Sonia was the legally wedded wife of Mengi.\n\nIt is out of the wedlock of Sonia and Mengi, two daughters namely\n\nBhagwania and Maiki were born. The appellants are the sons of Maiki\n\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">- the deceased daughter of Sonia.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_18\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">10.   In the circumstances it becomes difficult to accept the case set\n\nup by the respondent herein that he inherited the property after the\n\ndeath of Sonia. There is no acceptable evidence that he was born out\n\nof the relationship between Sonia and Teni. In order to overcome this\n\ndifficulty Debiya appears to have set up altogether a different case\n\nthat the possessory right of land was acquired from one Bhagwat\n\nPrasad Zamindar. But there is no acceptable evidence except the\n\nassertion of the respondent.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_20\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">11.   We have perused the objections filed by the appellants herein\n\nbefore the authority in which there is no such admission to the effect\n\nthat the respondent was born out of the \"illegal relationship between\n\nTeni and Sonia\" or any such admission in the evidence of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                   6</span>\n\n\nappellants. It is in the evidence of the appellant that Mengi died about\n\n55 years ago as told to them by none other than Sonia. It is also in\n\ntheir evidence that the respondent herein is the son of Teni and not of\n\nSonia. Teni was merely cultivating the land on behalf of the appellants.\n\nIt is also in their evidence that Sonia and respondent both lived\n\nseparately and never lived together. The other witnesses on behalf of\n\nthe appellants reiterated and supported the version given by the\n\nappellants that Teni does not belong to their village but came to the\n\nvillage in search of the work along with Debiya. It is in their evidence\n\nthat after the death of Mengi, Sonia did not give birth to any\n\nchild/children.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_22\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">12.   That so far as the evidence produced on behalf of the\n\nrespondent to the effect that Sonia and Mengi did not have any issues\n\nat all out of their wedlock does not inspire any confidence. It is a self-\n\nserving statement which cannot be accepted. No evidence has been\n\nproduced by the respondent that the property was acquired by Teni\n\nfrom one Bhagwat Prasad Zamindar as claimed by him. There is no\n\nrecord to that effect maintained by the revenue administration. On the\n\ncontrary, the entries made in Khasra 1333 and 1334F in respect of the\n\nland in question support the case of the appellants inasmuch as the\n\nname of Sonia has been recorded in the said documents.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                 7</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_24\">13.   That the Revisional Court after elaborate consideration of the\n\nmatter and upon appreciation of the evidence available on record in\n\ncategorical terms found that even during the lifetime of Teni and for a\n\nvery long time the name of Sonia has been continuously recorded in\n\nall the revenue records.   It is for that reason the Revisional Court\n\nfound that the plea set up by the respondent herein that the property\n\nin question was that of self-acquired property of his father Teni was\n\nnot acceptable. The Revisional Court also found that the name of the\n\nrespondent herein had never been entered in any of the records after\n\nthe death of his father Teni. The Revisional Court found that had it\n\nbeen self-acquired property of Teni the name of the respondent would\n\nhave been found place in the revenue records after the death of Teni.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_25\">14.   For all the aforesaid reasons it is clear from the evidence and\n\nmaterial available on record that the appellants herein never made any\n\nadmission that the respondent was born out of the illegal relationship\n\nof Teni and Sonia nor there is any such admission made by them in\n\ntheir evidence. The finding recorded by the Revisional Court that the\n\nproperty was always held and possessed by Sonia as her absolute\n\nproperty does not suffer from any error.        The finding that the\n\nappellants herein are the sons of Maiki - the deceased daughter of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                   8</span>\n\n\nSonia also does not suffer from any error as the same is based upon\n\nproper appreciation of evidence available on record. There is no\n\nevidence   whatsoever    to   arrive   at   any    proper       conclusion         that\n\nrespondent herein was born out of the wedlock/relationship between\n\nSonia and Teni.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_26\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_27\">15.   In our considered opinion, the High Court ought not to have\n\ninterfered in exercise of its jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 227</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India with the\n\n\n\ndecision of the Revisional Court which does not suffer from any factual\n\nand legal infirmities.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_28\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_29\">16.   For all the aforesaid reasons, the impugned order is set aside.\n\nThe appeal is accordingly allowed with no order as to costs.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_30\">                                            ..........................................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_31\">                                                        (S.B.

The High Court, after\n\nhearing both sides, by its impugned judgment held that the prayers made by the writ\n\npetitioner (respondent No.1 herein) were reasonable and directed that the Rule 26(B)\n\nbe inserted in the Delhi Higher Judicial Service Rules, 1970 (for short 'the Rules') and\n\nweightage of fifteen years of practice or such other number of years of practice at the\n\nBar whichever is less be given to the direct recruits while computing their pension and\n\nother retiral benefits, thereby allowed the writ petition.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">          Aggrieved by the said order, this appeal has been filed by the Government of\n\nNCT of Delhi challenging the aforesaid decision of the Delhi High Court.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">          We have heard learned counsel for the State and learned counsel for the\n\nLawyers Association and High Court of Delhi.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">          In the Delhi Higher Judicial Service, direct recruitment to 25% of posts are\n\nmade from amongst the members of the Bar who have completed seven years practice\n\nat the Bar. The minimum age for entry is 35 years and the maximum age is 45 years.\n\nThe main contention of the writ petitioner\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                           -3-</span>\n\n(respondent No.1 herein) before the High Court was to include the fifteen years'\n\fpractice at the Bar. If a candidate joinsat the age of 35 years and retires at the age of\n\n60 years, if not elevated to the Bench of the High Court, he would not be able to get full\n\npension as for getting full pension one should have 33 years of service whereas the total\n\nservice rendered by a member who joins at the age of 35 years will be 25 years of\n\nservice. The High Court, on the administrative side, brought this fact to the notice of\n\nthe government by writing a letter in the year 1987. Though repeated reminders were\n\nsent to the government,       no decision was taken by the Government till the end of\n\n2005 and only on 02nd February, 2006 by a letter, Government has indicated that it was\n\nagreeable to give weightage of 7 years of practice at the Bar while computing the\n\npension and other retiral benefits for direct recruits.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">          Learned counsel appearing for the State contended that the reason why\n\ngovernment has agreed to give weightage of 7 years practice at the Bar is that because\n\nin the case of direct recruitments to the Delhi Higher Judicial Service, a member\n\nshould have seven years' practice at the Bar and that is why Government thought it fit\n\nto give weightage of seven years. Learned counsel appearing for the first respondent-\n\nassociation submitted that High Court was right in directing\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                           -4-</span>\n\nthe government to give weightage of fifteen years' practice at the Bar while computing\n\npension and other retiral benefits because otherwise most of the members of the Delhi\n\nHigher Judicial Service would not be able to get full or adequate/reasonable pension at\n\nthe time of retirement. It is also submitted that better conditions of service should be\n\nmade available to the persons who are direct recruitees from the Bar otherwise the best\n\ntalent would not be attracted for selection. Learned counsel appearing for respondent\n\fNo.1-High Court of Delhi has also brought to our notice the fact that the request was\n\nmade by the High Court in the year 1987 and despite repeated reminders, Government\n\nhas acceded to the request only in the year 2006 by its letter dated 02nd February, 2006.\n\nIt is also brought to our notice by the learned counsel appearing for respondent No.2\n\nthat in the States of Punjab, Haryana and Gujarat, weightage of 10 years' practice at\n\nthe Bar is given in the case of direct recruits while computing pension and other retiral\n\nbenefits.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">            We have considered the various contentions raised before us. Learned\n\ncounsel appearing for the State vehemently contended that only the period of seven\n\nyears' practice at the Bar is to be added because the minimum qualification to enter\n\ninto the Delhi Higher Judicial Service as a direct recruit is seven years' practice at the\n\nBar. That reason, by itself,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                          -5-</span>\n\ndoes not appear to be justifiable as the total period of service for getting maximum or\n\nfull pension is 33 years as per the general rules of the Government of Delhi. Learned\n\ncounsel for the State submitted that if 15 years' practice at the Bar is added, then there\n\nis an apprehension that after joining the Delhi Higher Judicial Service and working for\n\na shorter period, members may quit the job because even after working for a shorter\n\nperiod, they will get the proportionate pension if their past practice of 15 years at the\n\nBar is added.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">            Having regard to the facts of the case and having heard learned counsel for\n\nthe parties, we deem it appropriate that 10 years practice at the Bar or such other\n\nnumber of years whichever is less, could be added while computing pension and other\n\fretiral benefits in the case of a direct recruit to the Delhi Higher Judicial Service. We\n\norder accordingly.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">          Insofar as apprehension of learned counsel for the State is concerned, we\n\nmake it clear that weightage of 10 years' practice at the Bar will be given only if the\n\ndirect recruit, who joins the Delhi Higher Judicial Service, actually works for minimum\n\nten years in the Delhi Higher Judicial Service and then retire so as to enable them to\n\nget reasonable/adequate pension at the time of retirement because as per general rules\n\nto be eligible for minimum pension a\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                         -6-</span>\n\nperson should have completed at least ten years of service. Government of NCT of\n\nDelhi is directed to suitably insert Rule 26(B) in the Delhi Higher Judicial Service\n\nRules, 1970.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">          The Appeal is partly allowed in the aforesaid terms.

Such prayer is allowed and that leaves us with 18 appellants. This order\n\n   will, accordingly, govern the said 18 appellants.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_2\">   4      The appellants claim to be Units, which have been enjoying linkage for supply\n\n   of coal vis-a-vis Bharat Coking Coal Limited (hereinafter referred to as \"BCCL\").\n\n   On 30th November, 2004, BCCL issued a notice No.BCCL/S&amp;M/Link/04/5089,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                           2</span>\n\nrequiring the linked consumers to submit detailed data/information in terms of the\n\ndetails mentioned in the notice along with an affidavit and the photographs of\n\nowners on or before 31st December, 2004, to enable it to cross check the genuineness\n\nof the working units regarding continuance of supply of coal for the year 2005. The\n\nsaid notice refers to 18 specific documents and item 19 refers to any other relevant\n\ndocuments.    It appears that subsequently the said number of documents were\n\nreduced to 13 as will appear from clause 10 of paragraph 12 of the counter affidavit\n\nfiled on behalf of   BCCL. The notice will, therefore, be confined to the said 12/13\n\ndocuments and also any other relevant documents.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_3\">5      The stoppage of supply, pursuant to the aforesaid notice, was questioned by\n\nthe appellants herein before the learned Single Judge of the Patna High Court, who\n\nby his judgment and order dated 10th January, 2008 held that the decision to stop\n\nsupply of coal on the failure of the appellants to produce all the documents in\n\nquestion could not be supported, particularly, in view of the fact that no hearing had\n\nbeen given to them before such stoppage.        On the ground of violation of the\n\nprinciples of natural justice the learned Single Judge declared the decision to stop\n\nsupply of coal to the appellants to be void ab initio and unenforceable.\n\nConsequently, the writ petition was allowed and the decision of the appellants herein\n\nto stop supply of coal to the appellants was set aside and BCCL was directed to\n\nforthwith resume supply of coal to the appellants. As against the decision of the\n\nlearned Single Judge, BCCL filed a Letters Patent Appeal, being LPA No.174 of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                            3</span>\n\n2008, which was disposed of on 24th April, 2008 relying on an earlier decision of the\n\nPatna High Court in M/s. Central Coalfields Ltd. &amp; Ors. Vs. M/s. Aman Line\n\nWorks &amp; Ors. Having regard to the said decision, the Division Bench allowed the\n\nLetters Patent Appeal to the extent that it was left open to BCCL to resume or not\n\nto resume supply of coal to the appellants till the proceedings were finally\n\ndetermined and after considering the explanation of the respondents in respect of the\n\nalleged deficiency. The Division Bench also observed that it would be open to the\n\nappellants to make up the alleged deficiency and to supply the required particulars,\n\nif they had necessary materials for the same along with the submission of their\n\nexplanation.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">6      The appellants are before us on a very narrow ground, namely, that in\n\naddition to a hearing been given to them, a direction should also be given to BCCL,\n\nif it was not satisfied with the documents produced, to conduct a spot\n\ninquiry/inspection, as had been directed by the Allahabad High Court in another\n\nsimilar matter.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">7      Having heard learned counsel for the respective parties, and also having\n\nregard to the fact that stoppage of supply of coal to the Units in question, if they are\n\ngenuine, will cause a great deal of hardship and would amount to closure of the\n\nindustry, at least for the time being, we are of the view that the directions given by\n\nthe Division Bench need not be interfered with, but we modify the same to the extent\n\nthat while considering the representations made by the appellants, in the event the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                                   4</span>\n\n      appellants are unable to produce a particular document, the authorities of BCCL\n\n      would permit the appellants to produce supporting documents in corroboration of\n\n      the documents which they are unable to produce, in order to effectively decide as to\n\n      whether the unit of the appellant in question, was a running unit or not.\n\n      8      This will not preclude BCCL from holding any inspection, if it so deems fit.\n\n      9      We also request BCCL to dispose of the representations at an early date and\n\n      preferably within two months from date.\n</p>\n<pre id=\"pre_3\">      10     The appeal is disposed of.\n\n      11     There will, however, be no order as to costs.\n\n\n                                                           ...................J.\n                               (ALTAMAS KABIR)\n\n\n\n                                               ...................J.\n                                          (CYRIAC JOSEPH)\n\nNew Delhi,\nJanuary 22, 2009.\n\f</pre>","tid":559959,"showurl":true,"citeList":[]}, {"numcites":0,"covertids":[],"covertitles":[],"relatedqs":[{"value":"resignation","formInput":"resignation"},{"value":"desertion","formInput":"desertion"},{"value":"pasayat","formInput":"pasayat"},{"value":"arijit pasayat","formInput":"arijit%20pasayat"}],"firstname":null,"title":"Raj Kumar Singh vs Union Of India & Ors on 27 January, 2009","url":"http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgst.aspx?filename=33557","lastname":"pasayat","secondname":"a","publishdate":"2009-01-27","citedbyList":[{"tid":917741,"url":null,"title":"Mahavir Singh vs Staff Selection Committee And ... on 17 January, 1986"},{"tid":1888962,"url":null,"title":"Om Prakash Sharma vs Union Of India (Uoi) And Ors. on 19 October, 2006"}],"covers":[],"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","numcitedby":2,"divtype":"judgments","doc":"<div class=\"docsource_main\">Supreme Court of India</div>\n<div class=\"doc_title\">Raj Kumar Singh vs Union Of India &amp; Ors on 27 January, 2009</div><div class=\"doc_author\">Author: .

Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment passed by a Division\n\nBench of the Guwahati High Court dismissing the writ appeal filed by the\n\nappellant. Appeal was directed against the judgment and order dated\n\f19.5.2003 passed by the learned Single Judge in Civil Rule No.3053 of\n\n1996. Appellant's case in the writ petition and the writ appeal was that\n\nwhile serving as Rifleman in the Assam Rifles he was removed from service\n\non the ground of desertion and that too without serving any notice to him as\n\nrequired under law and without holding any disciplinary proceedings. The\n\nrespondent-Union of India took the stand that the writ petitioner and others\n\ngot themselves involved in some controversies whereupon the writ\n\npetitioner was given punishment of quarters guard. Thereafter he submitted\n\na letter of resignation which was accepted by order dated 18.12.1995 to be\n\neffective from 29.2.1996. But before that date the writ petitioner deserted\n\nwhereupon he was declared as deserter and notices were served on him\n\nalong with others. Learned Single Judge held that the appellant was not\n\nremoved from service on the ground of desertion but on the ground that he\n\nhad sought for voluntary discharge from service which was accepted.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">3.    Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that there was, in fact, no\n\nvoluntary resignation and his signatures were taken on blank papers while\n\nhe was in illegal detention.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                    2</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">\f4.    Learned additional standing counsel referred to the letter dated\n\n21.11.1995 wherein the appellants clearly stated that he wanted the\n\nresignation from service due to domestic problem as there was nobody in\n\nthe family to look after it.    Three persons including the appellant had\n\nsubmitted for discharge from service at own request and the same request\n\nwas accepted on 23.11.1995 and the same was to be effective from\n\n29.2.1996.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">5.    We find that the authorities placed on record original letter dated\n\n23.11.1995. By order dated 18.12.1995, the DG, Assam Rifles passed the\n\norder and accepted the resignation on compassionate ground to be effective\n\nfrom 29.2.1996. The appellant has taken the stand that he has not given\n\nvoluntary resignation and the blank signatures were taken from him. The\n\nplea is clearly unsustainable. There is no material on record and, in fact, it\n\nis not the stand of the appellant that he made any grievance about the\n\naforesaid act before any authority. Whether he had signed the letter\n\nvoluntarily or signatures were taken on blank papers involves disputed\n\nquestions of fact which cannot be decided in a writ petition. Learned Single\n\nJudge and the Division Bench noted that the authorities have acted on the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                     3</span>\n\fbasis of the letter of resignation. That being so, there is no scope for\n\ninterference in this appeal.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">6.    Learned counsel for the appellant stated that the appellant may seek\n\nappropriate remedy for declaration that the letter was not voluntarily given.\n\nWe have expressed no opinion in that regard. If and when such remedy is\n\navailed, the question has to be decided in its proper perspective.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">7.    The appeal fails and is dismissed. No costs.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">                                         .........................................J.\n                                         (Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT)\n\n\n                                         ...........................................J.\n                                         (ASOK KUMAR GANGULY)\nNew Delhi,\nJanuary 27, 2009\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                     4</span>\n\f</p>","tid":1550100,"showurl":true,"citeList":[]}, {"numcites":0,"covertids":[],"covertitles":[],"relatedqs":[{"value":"inquiry officer","formInput":"inquiry%20officer"},{"value":"disciplinary authority","formInput":"disciplinary%20authority"}],"firstname":null,"title":"Union Of India Trh.

No.144 of 2006 filed by the respondent for\nquashing the orders passed by the competent authority for initiation of disciplinary\nproceedings and appointment of inquiry officer was dismissed by the Tribunal on 2nd\nJune, 2006. Against the said order, the High Court was moved in writ petition, which\nwas registered as Writ Petition No.35336 of 2006. The Division Bench of the High\nCourt passed several interim orders whereby repeated directions were issued to the\nappellants herein to file affidavits on one or the other issues. Hence, these appeals by\nspecial leave.\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">           A perusal of different orders passed by the High Court including orders\ndated 20th July, 2007 and 5th October, 2007 which are subject matter of challenge in\nthese appeals shows that the High Court has been making a roving inquiry in relation\nto matters which have direct bearing on the merits of the charge levelled against the\nrespondent ignoring the fact that the Tribunal dismissed the application of the\nrespondent on the ground that it was pre-mature and there was no valid ground to\nquash the proceedings of the inquiry at that stage. In our view, the High Court\nshould not have entertained the writ petition at the threshold of the disciplinary\nproceedings and passed orders touching the merits of the charge. Instead, the High\nCourt should have directed the disciplinary authority to conclude the inquiry after\ngiving opportunity of hearing to the respondent.\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">           Accordingly, the appeals are allowed, impugned orders rendered by the\nHigh Court are set aside and the writ petition filed by the respondent is dismissed.\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">                                                                                   ....3/-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                          -3-</span>\n<p id=\"p_8\">           Shri A.

He is stated to have died leaving a will\n\ndated 13.12.1967 bequeathing the suit lands to one Naseer\n\nBaig (father of appellants) subject to a life interest in\n\nfavour of Mariyam Bibi (wife of the testator).              The first\n\nrespondent is a transferee from Mariyam Bibi under sale\n\ndeed dated 11.10.1990.        On the death of Mariyam Bibi, the\n\nfirst respondent sought mutation to his name in the revenue\n\nrecords. The appellants objected. The Tehsildar by order\n\ndated 26.4.2001 overruled the objections of the appellants\n\nand directed mutation from the name Mariyam Bibi to that of\n\nfirst respondent.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                     1</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">\f3.   Feeling    aggrieved        the    appellants      appealed   to    the\n\nAdditional     District    Magistrate       (Sadar),      Sultanpur,      who\n\nallowed the appeal by order dated 9.10.2002 and directed\n\nthat the names of appellants be entered as the Bhumidars in\n\nplace of Mariyam Bibi and remanded the matter for rehearing\n\non merits after granting opportunity to the parties. The\n\nfirst respondent filed a revision against the said order.\n\nThe Additional Commissioner (Judicial), Faizabad rejected\n\nthe revision by order dated 25.10.2005 thereby affirming\n\nthe order of the appellate authority. The said order was\n\nchallenged by the first respondent in a writ petition.                       A\n\nlearned   Single   Judge    of    the    High   Court    by   order     dated\n\n29.3.2006 dismissed the writ petition filed by the first\n\nrespondent. Having dismissed it, he however observed that\n\nuntil the matter was decided by the Tahsildar on remand as\n\ndirected by the appellate authority, the entry of first\n\nrespondent's name in the revenue records will continue and\n\nthe possession of the first respondent will also continue\n\nundisturbed.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">4.   Being aggrieved by the said observation of the High\n\nCourt while dismissing the first respondent's writ petition\n\nthe appellants have filed this appeal by special leave.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                         2</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">\f5.     The Additional District Magistrate set aside the order\n\nof the Tahsildar directing mutation in the name of first\n\nrespondent, and directed that the name of the appellants\n\nshould be entered pending rehearing.                  The said order was\n\naffirmed by the revisional authority. The said order was\n\nalso   affirmed   by    the    High   Court   by   dismissing      the   writ\n\npetition filed of the first respondent. Having dismissed\n\nthe writ petition, the High Court ought not to have added\n\nany observation which would tend to virtually nullify the\n\ndismissal    of   the    writ   petition      as   also   orders    of   the\n\nappellate authority and the revisional authority which were\n\naffirmed by its order.

In the circumstances, we allow this appeal in part and\n\nset aside the observations in the impugned order to the\n\neffect that the entry of first respondent's name in the\n\nrevenue     records     will    continue      until    the   decision        of\n\nTahsildar and the first respondent's possession will not be\n\ndisturbed.

This appeal is directed against the judgment and\n\n  order dated 26th of June, 2000 of the Division\n\n  Bench of the High Court of Bombay at Panaji in\n\n  Letters Patent Appeal No.9 of 1999 whereby the\n\n  appeal was dismissed by the High Court based on\n\n  the decision passed in Letters Patent Appeal No.44\n\n  of 1998 decided on 13th of June, 2000.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                 1</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">\f2.   The relevant facts leading to the present appeal\n\nare as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">     The appellant is the owner of a property called\n\nVAGAD, survey No. 131, sub-division No. 33 and 37\n\nsituated at Paliem, Taluka Pernem, Goa, (hereinafter\n\nreferred to as \"the disputed property\"). Three persons\n\nnamely Vassu, Shankar and Bhiva were recorded as\n\ntenants in respect of the disputed property in 1972\n\nand the present respondents are their heirs and legal\n\nrepresentatives. The appellant applied before the\n\nCourt of Mamlatdar at Pernem, for a declaration that\n\nthe respondents were not tenants of the disputed\n\nproperty within the meaning of the Goa, Daman and\n\nDiu Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1964 (in short \"Goa\n\nTenancy Act). The Mamlatdar, after a detailed enquiry\n\ninto the facts, passed an order on 28th of October 1986\n\ngranting the aforesaid declaration in respect of the\n\ndisputed property. In appeal, the Deputy Collector\n\ndismissed the same and affirmed the order of the\n\nMamlatdar, by an order dated 5th of January 1992.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                               2</span>\n\fFurther, an appeal to the Administrative Tribunal was\n\ntaken, which reversed the orders of the Deputy\n\nCollector and the Mamlatdar, by an order dated 30th of\n\nJune, 1997 by re-appreciating the evidence on record.\n\nThe appellant filed a writ petition being WP No. 113 of\n\n1998, before the High Court of Bombay at Panaji,\n\nchallenging the order of the Administrative Tribunal.\n\nThe Writ Petition was dismissed on the ground that\n\nunder Section 7 of the Goa Tenancy Act, there was no\n\npower vested with the Mamlatdar to grant negative\n\ndeclaration. Aggrieved by this judgment, the appellant\n\nfiled a Letters Patent Appeal being LPA No. 9 of 1999\n\nbefore the Division Bench of the High Court. As noted\n\nherein earlier, the same was dismissed vide its\n\njudgment dated 26th of June, 2000. Thereafter, the\n\nappellant had filed this special leave petition in this\n\nCourt, which on grant of leave was heard by us in the\n\npresence of the learned counsel appearing on behalf of\n\nthe parties.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                               3</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">\f3.   We have heard the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the parties and examined the materials on\n\nrecord. The issue which we have to deal with while\n\ndisposing of this appeal is whether under Section 7 of\n\nthe Goa Tenancy Act, the Mamlatdar was vested with\n\nthe authority to grant a negative declaration to the\n\neffect that a particular person is/was not a tenant\n\nwhen any such dispute is/was referred to him for his\n\ndecision.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">4.   Before going into the rival contentions of the\n\nparties, it is necessary for us to refer to objects and\n\nreasons for enacting the Goa Tenancy Act. This Act\n\nhas been enacted to provide for the regulation of the\n\nterms of tenancy with respect to agricultural lands in\n\nthe Union Territory of Goa, Daman and Diu and for\n\nmatters connected therewith.    Section 7 of the Goa\n\nTenancy Act reads as under :-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     \"Section 7: Question of tenancy:- If any\n     question arises whether any person is or\n     was a tenant or should be deemed to be a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                4</span>\n\f     tenant under this Act the Mamlatdar shall,\n     after holding an inquiry, decide such\n     question.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     In any such enquiry, the Mamlatdar shall\n     presume that any statement as to the\n     existence of a right of tenancy in a record\n     of rights prepared in the prescribed\n     manner under and in accordance with the\n     provisions of this Act, is true.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_11\">5.   As noted hereinearlier, the learned Single Judge\n\nas well as the Division Bench of the High Court\n\ndecided   that   the   Mamlatdar    did     not    have   any\n\njurisdiction to grant a negative declaration following\n\nthe ratio of its decision in LPA No. 44 of 1998. On a\n\nconsideration of the objects and reasons of the Goa\n\nTenancy Act and the relevant provisions of the same,\n\nwe are of the view that although Section 7 of the Goa\n\nTenancy Act provides that where any question arises\n\nwhether any person is or should be deemed to be a\n\ntenant, the Mamlatdar shall, after holding an enquiry,\n\ndecide    such   question,   even   then,    the    negative\n\ndeclaration namely \"such a person is/was not a\n\ntenant\" should also be dealt with by the Mamlatdar for\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                     5</span>\n\fthe reasons stated hereinafter.      The expression in\n\nSection 7 of the Act as to the determination of the fact\n\nthat whether a person \"is or was a tenant\", would also\n\ninclude the question whether the person is not a\n\ntenant,   and   after   conducting   an   enquiry   the\n\nMamlatdar shall decide the same.          Therefore the\n\nquestion, which was raised, is that, if the Mamlatdar\n\nafter conducting an enquiry comes to the conclusion\n\nthat the concerned person is/was not a tenant, he is\n\nbound to mention the same. Therefore, it does also\n\namount to a declaration to the effect that the person is\n\nnot a tenant.    Accordingly, it results in a negative\n\ndeclaration. It bemuses us that when the wordings in\n\nthe section are clear to the effect that the Mamlatdar\n\nhas to decide about the tenancy of a concerned\n\nperson, the expression \"If any question arises\n\nwhether any person is or was a tenant.....\" can\n\npurport to have a meaning that the mamlatdar is not\n\nauthorized to issue a negative declaration that the\n\nperson is not a tenant.    This   expression, as noted\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                6</span>\n\fherein earlier also, is clear that when there is a\n\ndispute or doubt over the tenancy of a person, then\n\nthe Mamlatdar shall decide such question after\n\nconducting a due enquiry to establish the same.\n\nTherefore, if the conclusion of the Mamlatdar, on\n\nenquiry, is that a particular person is not a tenant, he\n\nis bound to declare such a person that he is not a\n\ntenant. We do not also have any doubt regarding the\n\nexpression \"is or was tenant\" in Section 7 of the Goa\n\nTenancy Act       which would include the positive\n\ndeclaration as well as the negative declaration. If the\n\nobservations made by the Division Bench of the High\n\nCourt are accepted, it would then mean that if a\n\nperson approaches the Mamlatdar to declare him as a\n\ntenant or on the application of a landlord for a\n\ndecision   on   the   tenancy   of   his   occupant,   the\n\nMamlatdar ultimately reaches to a conclusion that the\n\nconcerned person whose tenancy has to be decided is\n\nnot a tenant, he has to refrain from taking any\n\ndecision and decline to exercise his jurisdiction. Such\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                  7</span>\n\fa situation would be unacceptable, untenable and a\n\nsheer waste of time of the Mamlatdar to conduct a\n\ndetailed enquiry under Section 7 of the Goa Tenancy\n\nAct on the application filed before it. This, in our view,\n\ncannot be the intention of the Legislature to create\n\nsuch an ambiguous position, which would result in a\n\nlengthy procedure, that might ultimately yield no\n\nresult.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">6.   At the risk of repetition, it is pertinent to mention\n\nthat the expression \"if any question arises\" embraces\n\nwithin    its   sweep   both   the   facets,   i.e.,   positive\n\ndeclaration as well as negative declaration, and the\n\nconclusion can be reached only at the end of the\n\nenquiry. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of\n\nthe appellant contended that if we examine the\n\nprovision of section 7 of the Goa Tenancy Act and also\n\nSection 70 of the Bombay Tenancy Act, it would be\n\nevident that both the provisions are similar in nature\n\nand are pari-materia to each other. We have already\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                       8</span>\n\fquoted Section 7 of the Goa Tenancy Act. It is,\n\ntherefore, necessary now to reproduce Section 70 of\n\nthe Bombay Tenancy Act which is as follows :-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">     \"Section 70-Duties of the Mamlatdar:-\n     \"For the purposes of this Act, the following\n     shall be the duties and the functions to be\n     performed by the Mamlatdar :-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">     (a) To decide whether a person is an\n         agriculturist;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">     (b) To decide whether a person is, or was at\n         any time in the past, a tenant or a\n         protected tenant or a permanent tenant...\n         ........\".\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_14\">7.   In this connection, Section 85 of the Bombay\n\nTenancy Act is also necessary to be produced. Section\n\n85 of the said Act is as follows:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">     \"Section 85 - Bar of Jurisdiction\n     (1)      No Civil Court shall have jurisdiction to\n              settle, decide or deal with any question\n              (including a question whether a person\n              is or was at the time in the past a\n              tenant and whether any such tenant is\n              or should be deemed to have\n              purchased from his landlord the land\n              held by him) which is by or under this\n              Act required to be settled, decided or\n              dealt with by the Mamlatdar or\n              Tribunal, a Manager, the collector or\n              the Maharashtra Revenue Tribunal in\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                  9</span>\n\f                  appeal or on revision, the State\n                  Government in exercise of their powers\n                  of control.\n</blockquote>\n<pre id=\"pre_2\">       (2)        No order of the Mamlatdar, the\n                  Tribunal,    the Collector or    the\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">                  Maharashtra Revenue Tribunal or the\n                  State Government made under this Act\n                  shall be questioned in any civil or\n                  criminal court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">       Explanation:- For the purposes of this section a\n       Civil Court shall include a Mamlatdar's Court\n       constituted under the Mamlatdar Courts Act,\n       1906.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_15\">8.     From a bare perusal of Section 85 of the Bombay\n\nTenancy Act, it would be evident that this provision\n\nbars the jurisdiction of Civil Court to deal with any\n\nquestion including a question whether a person is or\n\nwas at the time in the past a tenant and whether any\n\nsuch     tenant    is   or   should   be   deemed   to    have\n\npurchased from his landlord the land held by him\n\nwhich would be decided or dealt with only by the\n\nMamlatdar or Tribunal or a Manager, the Collector or\n\nthe Maharashtra Revenue Tribunal in appeal or\n\nrevision by the State Government in exercise of their\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                                     10</span>\n\fpowers of control. When a question arises whether a\n\nparticular person is an agriculturist or a tenant or not,\n\nit is only the Mamlatdar who has the jurisdiction to\n\ndecide the same. The question, therefore, is whether\n\nunder Section 70 of the Bombay Tenancy Act, the\n\nMamlatdar has the power or jurisdiction to grant a\n\nnegative declaration that is whether the concerned\n\nperson is or was not a tenant. <a href=\"/doc/1885259/\" id=\"a_1\">In Nivrutti Laxman\n\nKondobahiri vs. Shiv Dayal Laxminarayan Sarda &amp;\n\nOrs</a>.     [AIR    1960     Bombay      56]    (Full   Bench),\n\nHon.Chainani,      C.J.   (as   His   Lordship   then     was)\n\nobserved :-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">       \"It has, however, been urged that while an\n       application may be made to a Mamlatdar for\n       obtaining a declaration that a person is a\n       tenant, an application for a negative\n       declaration that a person is not a tenant,\n       is not competent. It has been contended that\n       the object of the Act is to protect tenant and\n       that it confers special rights upon them and\n       that consequently, where the owner of a\n       land alleges that person is not a tenant or\n       that he is not entitled to be protection of the\n       Act, the application cannot be said to be one\n       for the purposes of the Act. There does not\n       seem to us to be much force in this\n       argument. The purposes of the Act are, as\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                                     11</span>\n\fwill be seen from the preamble, to regulate\nthe relations of landlords and tenants of\nagricultural lands. While the Act confers\nextensive rights on tenants, the landlords\nare not deprived of all their rights - For\ninstances, they can terminate the tenancies\nand resume possession of their lands in\ncertain circumstances. Under Section 29,\nboth the landlords and the tenants can\napply to the Mamlatdar for obtaining\npossession of lands. Under clause (b) of\nSection 70 of the act, the Mamlatdar has\njurisdiction to determine whether a person\nis a tenant. He can, therefore, also decide\nthat a person is not a tenant. If he can\ndecide this question, on an application\nmade to him by a tenant, it is difficult to\nunderstand why he should not be able to\ndecide this question, when the application is\nmade by the landlord. In either case, the\nquestion which the Mamlatdar will have to\ndetermine is whether the relationship of\nlandlord and tenant exists between the\nparties. The jurisdiction to decide this\nquestion vests exclusively in the Mamlatdar\nand the Civil Court is not competent to\ndecide it. This question will also have to be\ndetermined by reference to and in the light\nof the provisions of the Act as to who are\nand who are deemed to be tenants and as\nto how and in what circumstances a\ntenancy can be terminated. Such a\ndetermination will, therefore, be for the\npurpose of the Act. The words for the\npurpose of this Act, in our opinion, mean for\nthe purposes of deciding any question\nrelation to a matter, which is regulated or\ngoverned by the provisions of this Act. If,\ntherefore, the question raised before the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                            12</span>\n\f     Mamlatdar relates to a matter, which is to\n     be decided by reference to the provisions of\n     the Act, its determination by the Mamlatdar\n     will be for the purposes of the Act and it is\n     immaterial whether the application raising\n     the question is made by the landlord or by\n     the tenant.\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p id=\"p_16\">9.   Similar was the view expressed by the Bombay\n\nHigh Court relating to Section 70 of the Bombay\n\nTenancy Act in the decision in <a href=\"/doc/1590569/\" id=\"a_2\">Trimbak Sopan vs.\n\nGanga Ram Mhatarba</a> [AIR 1953 Bombay 241] in\n\nwhich the Bombay High Court observed as follows :-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">     \".............A very interesting argument has\n     been advanced by Mr.Tarkunde, and his\n     contention is that a suit against a trespasser\n     is only cognizable by the civil court, and\n     therefore, if an issue arises in such a suit as\n     to whether it is for the civil court to decide\n     that issue: if the defendant is a trespasser,\n     the Civil Court has jurisdiction to pass a\n     decree for possession; if, on the other hand,\n     the civil court comes to the conclusion that the\n     defendant is a protected tenant, then the\n     Court would have no jurisdiction and the suit\n     would have to be dismissed or sent to the\n     Mamlatdar to dispose of it according of law.</blockquote><p id=\"p_17\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">            Mr.Tarkunde's further contention is that\n     it is only to those issues which the Mamlatdar\n     is required to determine in a proceeding\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                   13</span>\n\fwhich should be filed before the Mamlatdar\nthat Section 70(b) has any application........\n\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">       .............Now, if this argument was\nsound, really no occasion would ever arise\nfor the Mamlatdar to decide the issue as to\nwhether a person is a tenant or a protected\ntenant, because, if a person could only go to\nthe Mamlatdar in those case where he\nadmitted that the defendant was a tenant or\na protected tenant, then the issue as to\nwhether the person was a tenant or a\nprotected tenant would not arise. Such an\nissue can only arise when there is a dispute\nas to the status of the particular person, and\nit is only when an allegation is made that the\nperson is not a tenant or a protected tenant\nthat the Mamlatdar would be called upon to\ntry such an issue. Now, it is clear that the\nquestion whether a person is a tenant or a\nprotected tenant is not a jurisdictional fact as\nfar as the Mamlatdar is concerned but is a\nfact in issue.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_20\">The jurisdiction of the Mamlatdar does not\ndepend upon the person being a tenant or a\nprotected tenant. On the contrary, the\nMamlatdar himself has been given the\njurisdiction to try the question as to whether a\nperson is a tenant or a protected tenant.\n\nMr.Tarkunde says that the issue before the\ncivil court is not whether the defendant is a\nprotected tenant or not, but the issue is\nwhether the defendant is a trespasser or a\nprotected tenant. In my opinion, when the\nLegislature has left it to the Mamlatdar to\ndecide the issue whether the defendant is a\nprotected tenant or not, it implies that he must\ndecide that the defendant is not a trespasser\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                              14</span>\n\f      in order to hold that he is a tenant or a\n      protected tenant and he must also hold that\n      he is a trespasser in order to determine that\n      he is not a tenant or a protected tenant. I\n      agree with Mr.Tarkunde that the provisions\n      in law which oust the jurisdiction of the civil\n      court must be strictly construed. But\n      considering it as strictly as I can, looking to\n      the language used by the Legislature in\n      Section 70(b) of the Tenancy Act, and looking\n      to the scheme of the Act, it seems to me clear\n      that all questions with regard to the status of\n      a party, when the party claims the status of a\n      protected tenant, are left to be determined by\n      the Revenue Court, and the jurisdiction of the\n      civil court is ousted............\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_21\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">10.   In view of the discussions made hereinabove, we\n\nare, therefore, of the view that under Section 7 of the\n\nGoa Tenancy Act, which is pari-materia with Section\n\n70 of the Bombay Tenancy Act, the Mamlatdar is\n\nconferred with power to decide the question after\n\nholding an enquiry whether a particular person is or is\n\nnot a tenant of the disputed property.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">11.   It is true that the High Court by the impugned\n\njudgment has distinguished the two provisions of the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                                   15</span>\n\ftwo different Acts, namely, Section 7 of the Goa\n\nTenancy Act and Section 70 of the Bombay Tenancy\n\nAct relying on the provisions of Section 4 of the Goa\n\nTenancy Act. According to the High Court, if Section 7\n\nof the Goa Tenancy Act and Section 70 of the Bombay\n\nTenancy Act could be considered as pari materia in\n\nthat case the Mamlatdar could decide the question,\n\ni.e. the concerned person is or is not a tenant, there\n\nwould be no need to provide for negative declaration\n\nunder Section 4 of the Goa Tenancy Act. According to\n\nthe High Court, the cardinal principle of interpretation\n\nwas that the duty of the court is to give effect to the\n\nintendment of the legislature. Once the legislature has\n\nexpressly provided for grant of negative declaration in\n\nlimited   cases,   it   would   contemplate   ouster   of\n\njurisdiction in matters other than Section 4. This\n\nwould also be a harmonious construction as the\n\njurisdiction of the civil court would not be ousted and\n\nthere would be no conflicting judgments. Making these\n\nobservations, the High Court held that the language of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                                 16</span>\n\f            the Goa Tenancy Act contemplates that no negative\n\n            declaration can be granted by the Mamlatdar under\n\n            Section 7 of the Goa Tenancy Act. At the same time,\n\n            the High Court also observed that, of course, when the\n\n            issue arises whether the person is a tenant or not\n\n            before the Mamlatdar, he could always decide whether\n\n            the person who claims the right has so proved or not.\n\n            It was also the finding of the High Court that the\n\n            jurisdiction of the Mamlatdar to decide whether the\n\n            concerned person is or was not a tenant, was inherent\n\n            in deciding the said issue. Before we proceed further,\n\n            let us produce Section 4 of the Goa Tenancy Act which\n\n            runs as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">                 \"Section 4 - Persons deemed to be tenants -\n                 A person lawfully cultivating any land\n                 belonging to another person (hereinafter in\n                 this section referred to as the owner) on or\n                 after the 1st of July, 1962 but before the\n                 commencement of this Act, shall be deemed\n                 to be a tenant if such land is not cultivated\n                 personally by the owner and if such person\n                 is not -\n</blockquote><p id=\"p_24\">(i)    a member of the owner's family, or\n</p><p id=\"p_25\">(ii)   a servant on wages payable in cash or kind but not in\n       crop share or a hired labourer cultivating the land under\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                                              17</span>\n\f        the personal supervision of the owner or of any member\n        of the owner's family, or\n</p><p id=\"p_26\">(iii)   a mortgagee in possession.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_27\">                  Provided that if upon an application made by\n                  the landlord within one year from the\n                  commencement of this Act to the Mamlatdar\n                  within whose jurisdiction the land is\n                  situated:-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_28\">                  (a) the Mamlatdar declares that such person\n                      is not a tenant and his decision is not\n                      reversed on appeal or revision, or\n\n</p><p id=\"p_29\">                  (b) the Mamlatdar refuses to make such\n                      declaration but his decision is reversed on\n                      appeal or revision,\n\n                  such person shall not be deemed to be a\n                  tenant under this Section.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_30\">                  Provided further that a sub-tenant cultivating\n                  any land belonging to another person [on or\n                  after the 1st of July, 1962, but before the\n                  commencement        of   this     Act]   shall,\n                  notwithstanding the fact that the creation of\n                  the sub-tenancy might have been prohibited\n                  by any law for the time being in force, be\n                  deemed to be lawfully cultivating the land as\n                  a tenant for the purposes of this section; and\n                  in such cases, the intermediary tenant or\n                  tenants prior to the creation of the sub-\n                  tenancy shall not be deemed to be tenant or\n                  tenants for the purposes of this Act;\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_31\">                  Provided further that in the case of a person\n                  claiming to be a tenant on the ground that he\n                  was a sub-tenant cultivating any land after\n                  the    1st   July,1962,    but   before   the\n                  commencement of this Act, the application by\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                               18</span>\n\f      the landlord for a declaration that such\n      person is not a tenant may be made within\n      three months of the commencement of the\n      Goa, Daman and Diu Agricultural Tenancy\n      (Amendment) Act, 1966.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_32\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_33\">12.   A plain reading of this provision which in addition\n\nwould show that legislature has provided by introducing\n\nSection 4 that the landlord can seek a negative\n\ndeclaration in respect of the category of persons\n\nmentioned in Section 4(1). It is true that under Section\n\n4(1) of the Goa Tenancy Act, the Mamlatdar is conferred\n\nwith jurisdiction to declare the category of person\n\nmentioned therein is or was not a tenant in respect of\n\nthe disputed property. But if we read Section 7 and the\n\nobjects and reasons of the Act and considering the fact\n\nthat for a limited purpose the Mamlatdar is conferred\n\nwith such power to declare the negative declaration in\n\nrespect of the certain category of persons under Section\n\n4(1) of the Goa Tenancy Act, it cannot be said that while\n\ndeciding the question under <a href=\"/doc/816397/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 7</a> of the Goa\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                                19</span>\n\fTenancy Act, the jurisdiction of the Mamlatdar to\n\ndeclare that the concerned person is or was not a\n\ntenant is ousted. Accordingly, we are of the view that\n\nthe High Court was not justified in holding that a\n\nMamlatdar is not conferred under Section 7 of the Goa\n\nTenancy Act to deal with and decide whether the\n\nconcerned person is a tenant or not a tenant in respect\n\nof the disputed property.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_34\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_35\">13.   Again it is needed to be mentioned that the\n\njurisdiction under Section 7 of the Goa Tenancy Act is\n\nnot confined to cases where the relationship of the\n\nlandlord and tenant is admitted. In fact, it is only where\n\nthe said relationship is alleged by one party and denied\n\nby the other that the question falls to be considered and\n\nthe decision of the question is left exclusively to be\n\ndetermined by the Mamlatdar under the provision of the\n\nAct. It is likely that a trespasser would thereby be able\n\nto prolong litigation between him and the owner of the\n\nproperty by frivolously raising a plea that he is a tenant\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                                 20</span>\n\for a protected tenant; but, on the other hand, a\n\nlandlord may also frivolously allege that a tenant is a\n\ntrespasser. We must, therefore, hold that the only\n\nforum that can deal with this plea is the Mamlatdar. If\n\nhe rejects the plea, then only the dispute between the\n\nowner and the trespasser would be triable by the\n\nordinary Civil Court; but otherwise, the Mamlatdar\n\nalone would decide the dispute in so far as it falls\n\nwithin the purview of the Act. In our view, the\n\njurisdiction of the Mamlatdar under Section 7 of the\n\nGoa Tenancy Act is not confined to cases where the\n\nquestion is whether a person is or was a tenant in\n\nrespect of the disputed property. The High Court in the\n\nimpugned judgment, as noted herein earlier, held that\n\nthe provisions of the Bombay Tenancy Act and Goa\n\nTenancy Act are similar, but in view of Section 4 of the\n\nGoa Tenancy Act, the decisions of the Bombay Tenancy\n\nAct, as referred to herein earlier, could not be applied in\n\nthe present case. We are unable to subscribe this view.\n\nWhen the legislature has provided that the landlord can\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                                  21</span>\n\fseek a negative declaration in respect of the category of\n\nperson mentioned in Section 4(1) of the Goa Tenancy\n\nAct, it cannot conclusively lead to the conclusion that in\n\nother cases, namely, where the question arises as to\n\nwhether a person is or is not a tenant, the Mamlatdar is\n\nnot   conferred   with   any power    to   grant   negative\n\ndeclaration that the concerned person is not a tenant in\n\nrespect of the disputed property. Accordingly, we are of\n\nthe view that the Mamlatdar had the jurisdiction to\n\ndeclare a negative declaration, that is to say, a\n\nparticular person is not a tenant under Section 7 of the\n\nGoa Tenancy Act and, therefore, the judgment of the\n\nHigh Court cannot be sustainable.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_36\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_37\">14.   That apart, in our view, the scope of Section 7 of\n\nthe Goa Tenancy Act is quite different from that of\n\nSection 4 of the Goa Tenancy Act. <a href=\"/doc/875938/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 4</a> is to\n\noperate from within a limited period of one year from\n\nthe date of enforcement of the Act, i.e., 8th of February,\n\n1965, while <a href=\"/doc/816397/\" id=\"a_5\">section 7</a> is operative for all time.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                                   22</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_38\">\f15.   For the reasons aforesaid, we set aside the\n\njudgment of the High Court and restore the order of the\n\nMamlatdar and the application filed by the appellant\n\nbefore the Mamlatdar stands allowed.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_39\">16.   The appeal is accordingly allowed. There will be no\n\norder as to costs.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_40\">                                     ...........................\n</p><p id=\"p_41\">                                                          ...J.\n</p><p id=\"p_42\">                                 [TARUN CHATTERJEE]\n\n\n\nNEW DELHI;                         .............................J.\n</p><pre id=\"pre_3\">January 29, 2009                      [AFTAB ALAM]\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                                      23</span>\n\f</pre>","tid":1355810,"showurl":true,"citeList":[{"tid":816397,"url":null,"title":"Section 7 in The Goa, Daman And Diu (Administration) Act,   1962"},{"tid":1590569,"url":null,"title":"Trimbak Sopana vs Gangaram Mhatarba on 17 July, 1952"},{"tid":875938,"url":null,"title":"Section 4 in The Goa, Daman And Diu (Administration) Act,   1962"},{"tid":1885259,"url":null,"title":"Nivruthi Laxman Kondobahiri vs Shivdayal Laxminarayan Sarda And ... on 20 January, 1959"}]}, {"numcites":6,"covertitles":[],"relatedqs":[{"value":"304 part i","formInput":"304%20part%20i"},{"value":"section 304 part ii ipc","formInput":"section%20304%20part%20ii%20ipc"},{"value":"304 ipc part ii of ipc","formInput":"304%20ipc%20part%20ii%20of%20ipc"},{"value":"304 ipc part ii","formInput":"304%20ipc%20part%20ii"},{"value":"section 304 part ii","formInput":"section%20304%20part%20ii"},{"value":"section 304(a) and 304 part ii","formInput":"section%20304%28a%29%20and%20304%20part%20ii"},{"value":"304 part i of ipc ","formInput":"304%20part%20i%20of%20ipc%20"},{"value":" manjit singh","formInput":"%20manjit%20singh"},{"value":"304 part ii","formInput":"304%20part%20ii"},{"value":"section 304 of indian penal code","formInput":"section%20304%20of%20indian%20penal%20code"},{"value":"section 304 ipc","formInput":"section%20304%20ipc"},{"value":"sec.304 ipc","formInput":"sec.304%20ipc"},{"value":"sec 304(a) of ipc","formInput":"sec%20304%28a%29%20of%20ipc"},{"value":"section 304(a)of indian penal code","formInput":"section%20304%28a%29of%20indian%20penal%20code"},{"value":"taxi","formInput":"taxi"},{"value":"sec 304 ii of ipc","formInput":"sec%20304%20ii%20of%20ipc"},{"value":" IPC 304   ,304 a ","formInput":"%20IPC%20304%20%20%20%2C304%20a%20"},{"value":"304 ipc","formInput":"304%20ipc"},{"value":"indian penal code 304","formInput":"indian%20penal%20code%20304"},{"value":"304 -ii ipc","formInput":"304%20-ii%20ipc"}],"citeList":[{"tid":409589,"url":null,"title":"Section 304 in The Indian Penal Code"},{"tid":1569253,"url":null,"title":"The Indian Penal Code"},{"tid":1534338,"url":"http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgst.aspx?filename=28969","title":"Abdul Aziz vs State Of Rajasthan on 3 May, 2007"},{"tid":561833,"url":"http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgst.aspx?filename=18617","title":"Ruli Ram And Anr vs State Of Haryana on 17 September, 2002"},{"tid":1597655,"url":null,"title":"Section 7 in The Indian Penal Code"}],"covers":[],"title":"Jarnail Singh vs State Of Punjab on 15 January, 2009","publishdate":"2009-01-15","divtype":"judgments","citedbyList":[],"tid":184398,"showurl":true,"covertids":[],"firstname":null,"lastname":"sharma","numcitedby":0,"secondname":"m","docsource":"Supreme Court of India","url":"http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgst.aspx?filename=33496","doc":"<div class=\"docsource_main\">Supreme Court of India</div>\n<div class=\"doc_title\">Jarnail Singh vs State Of Punjab on 15 January, 2009</div><div class=\"doc_author\">Author: .

Ramtar (hereinafter referred to as `deceased') was the younger brother\n\n   of the Harjinder Kumar, the complainant, both sons of Jiwa Nath.

When they reached the point\n\nfrom where a kacha path takes off to village Kasiana, they found the\n\nabovementioned Maruti Van with its headlight on, lying parked with its\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                                                        3</span>\n\nwindows open at a distance of about 1 = Killa from the metalled road.

An exchange\n\nof hot words ensued. Accused dealt two stab blows with knife, one on the\n\nchest and other on right flank of deceased.         The deceased became\n\nunconscious and rolled down on the ground through the right window of the\n\nvan. On sensing that deceased has succumbed to the injuries, accused\n\nplunged the knife into his chest, in order to commit suicide.   The knife fell\n\ndown from his grip in the van.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">      After having arranged a tractor the deceased and accused were\n\nbrought to Rajindra Hospital, Patiala.

Manjit Singh, Sarpanch, the alleged eye witness\n\n  was also examined as PW6 but he did not support the prosecution\n\n  version, not even the presence of PW7 at the time of occurrence.\n\n  Consequently he was declared hostile. Chanan Singh another alleged\n\n  eye witness was given up on the ground that he has been won over by\n\n  the accused.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">6. In the FIR it was stated by PW-7, the alleged eye witness, that the\n\n  deceased brother first gave a knife blow in the chest of the accused and\n\n  thereafter the accused gave two stab blows with his knife on the person\n\n  of deceased. The same set of allegation was made by said PW-7 even\n\n  before the police during the course of investigation. However, during\n\n  the trial he stated that there was an exchange of hot words between the\n\n  accused and the deceased consequent to which the accused gave two\n\n  stab blows with the knife to the deceased, one of which fell on the chest\n\n  whereas the other on the right flank of the deceased. It was also stated\n\n  in the evidence by the said PW-7 that on seeing that the deceased had\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                                                        6</span>\n\n   died the accused attempted to commit suicide by plunging the knife on\n\n   the left side of his chest.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">7. On the other hand, the accused put forth that he was learning driving\n\n   from the deceased, who was his friend. He stated that on the day of the\n\n   occurrence three unidentified person hired the van of the deceased and\n\n   on reaching the spot, deceased refused to take his van on kacha path\n\n   and those person picked up a row with him and they assaulted both the\n\n   deceased and the accused with the Gatra Kirpan due to which both of\n\n   them suffered injuries. He further stated that he became unconscious\n\n   on receipt of injury in his stomach and subsequently he was involved in\n\n   this case.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_18\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">8. The learned Additional Sessions Judge, on appreciation of the evidence\n\n   on record held that though the injury on the accused could have been\n\n   self inflicted as stated by the doctor, but even considering that the same\n\n   was inflicted in self-defence, the right of self-defence to the extent of\n\n   causing the death of the deceased was not available to the accused.\n\n   On noticing and appreciating the fact that there was allegation of an\n\n   exchange of hot words and that the incident occurred at the spur of the\n\n   moment without any premeditation, the learned Additional Sessions\n\n   Judge found the accused guilty and convicted him under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 304</a>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                                                          <a href=\"/doc/1597655/\" id=\"a_9\">7</a></span>\n\n   Part II IPC and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for\n\n   eight years.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_20\">9. On an appeal being filed by the appellant as against the aforesaid order\n\n   of conviction and sentence the learned Single Judge heard the parties\n\n   on merits. While maintaining the finding of guilt against the appellant the\n\n   learned Single Judge, however, convicted the appellant under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_10\">Section\n\n   304</a> Part I IPC by altering the same from one under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 304</a> Part II\n\n   IPC. However, taking into consideration the fact that the accused has\n\n   become permanently physically handicapped and his disability is 80%\n\n   the learned Single Judge reduced the sentence to five years instead of\n\n   eight years.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_21\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">10.The accused filed the present appeal as against the aforesaid orders.\n\n   We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the appellant-\n\n   accused as also learned counsel appearing for the State and also\n\n   scrutinised the evidence on record.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_23\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_24\">11.The learned counsel appearing for the appellant submitted before us\n\n   that the presence of PW-7, the only eye witness supporting the alleged\n\n   story of the prosecution, at the spot is too providential to be true. It was\n\n   also submitted that although it is alleged that the First Information\n\n   Report was recorded at 10.30 or 11.00 p.m., but in the inquest report\n\n   which was drawn at 7.00 a.m. on the next day, in the place of the F.I.R\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                                                        8</span>\n\n   number no particulars were given and only a dash was shown and the\n\n   F.I.R number was inserted at the later point of time. Relying on the said\n\n   fact it was submitted that the first information report was submitted late\n\n   and belatedly on the next date i.e. on 16.11.1993 at about 9.00 a.m. He\n\n   further submitted that the statement of PW-7 is full of embellishment\n\n   and contradictions from his previous statement. He drew our attention\n\n   to the allegation made in the first information report and to the\n\n   statement of said PW-7.      He submitted that said PW-7 is neither\n\n   trustworthy nor reliable, and therefore, the appellant should have been\n\n   acquitted instead of being convicted in the aforesaid manner.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_25\">12.The learned counsel appearing for the respondent, on the other hand,\n\n   submitted that both the courts below namely the High Court and the\n\n   learned Additional Sessions Judge found the appellant guilty of the\n\n   offence and the said findings and conclusion reached should not be\n\n   interfered with.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_26\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_27\">13.The learned Additional Sessions Judge found the appellant guilty of the\n\n   offence and convicted the appellant-accused under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 304</a> Part II\n\n   IPC. The prosecution did not file any appeal as against the aforesaid\n\n   order of conviction and sentence whereas the appellant-accused filed\n\n   an appeal against his order of conviction.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                                                        9</span><p id=\"p_28\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_29\">14.It is established fact that the offence of <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 304</a> Part I IPC is of a\n\n   higher degree than that of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 304</a> Part II IPC, as\n\n   also held in <a href=\"/doc/561833/\" id=\"a_15\">Ruli Ram v. State of Haryana</a> [(2002) 7 SCC 691, Para 8].\n\n   The learned Single Judge, therefore, was not justified in converting the\n\n   order of conviction and altering the same from <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 304</a> Part II IPC to\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 304</a> Part I IPC, particularly when the prosecution did not file any\n\n   appeal. By virtue of the order passed by the learned Single Judge the\n\n   appellant stood convicted of a higher degree of offence than that of\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 304</a> Part II IPC, although the learned Single Judge altered the\n\n   sentence from eight years to five years. In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1534338/\" id=\"a_19\">Abdul Aziz v.\n\n   State of Rajasthan</a> [(2007) 10 SCC 283] it was held by this Court that if\n\n   a person is charged under a grave Section, but however, if acquitted\n\n   under the said grave section by the Trial Court, then it would amount to\n\n   travesty of Justice if in his own appeal he is convicted under that grave\n\n   section, without there being any appeal from the State and without there\n\n   being prior notice of enhancement issued by the appellate Court.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_30\">15.Be that as it may, it is necessary now to consider whether the\n\n   prosecution case as alleged could be said to be trustworthy and reliable,\n\n   for which we are required to refer and analyse the evidence as adduced\n\n   by the parties.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                                                       10</span><p id=\"p_31\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_32\">16.According to the prosecution the incident took place on 15.11.1993 at\n\n  about 6.30 p.m. which was an incident happening on an evening of the\n\n  winter season.    The deceased who was the brother of PW-7 was\n\n  allegedly driving the van which was parked at the place of incident with\n\n  windows open and headlights on, which meant that it was dark at that\n\n  point of time. Although it was a winter night still the windows of the car\n\n  were kept open, for which according to the prosecution, PW-7 could see\n\n  the entire incident.   In the first information report PW-7 stated that\n\n  initially a knife blow was given by the deceased to the accused and\n\n  thereafter the accused gave two knife blows to the deceased, which\n\n  resulted in his death and consequently his body came out of the\n\n  window. The aforesaid version as stated in the first information report,\n\n  was however, later on changed and altered when PW-7 deposed in the\n\n  court that the accused after giving two knife blows to the deceased\n\n  attempted to commit suicide by plunging the knife in his chest.         In\n\n  support of the said contention reliance was placed on the evidence of\n\n  the doctor who has stated during his examination that the aforesaid\n\n  injury on the accused could have been self inflicted also. PW-7 is said\n\n  to be the eye witness who has allegedly seen the entire occurrence\n\n  including the exchange of hot words between the appellant and the\n\n  deceased in a winter night and that also when it was totally dark.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                                                         11</span>\n\n   According to him, he could see the entire incident in the light of the\n\n   headlight of the car.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_33\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_34\">17.The aforesaid statement of PW-7 does not appear to be trustworthy and\n\n   reliable for the simple reason that even though the headlight of the car\n\n   was on, it would be lighting only the front portion and not the side of the\n\n   car and may not even have lighted sufficiently to enable PW 7 to see as\n\n   to what had happened inside the car. Although it was a winter night it is\n\n   not stated nor understood as to why the windows of the car were kept\n\n   open. It is also not stated by PW-7 that he had made any effort to help\n\n   or render assistance to stop the verbal dual between the accused and\n\n   the deceased or took any effective steps to stop the stabbing on both\n\n   the persons. PW-7 had further stated that his brother was a driver of\n\n   the van and that the incident had happened because he was unwilling to\n\n   take the vehicle by the village path. However, in his deposition he has\n\n   stated that his brother was seated at the back seat alongwith the\n\n   deceased.    It is not understood as to why the driver of the vehicle\n\n   driving the car would seat in the back seat of the car instead of driving\n\n   the car from the front seat. Presence of PW-7 at the spot at that point\n\n   of time was also providential and he has been examined only as a\n\n   chance witness. The other alleged eye witness namely Chanan Singh,\n\n   Member Panchayat of village Kasiana was not examined at all on the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                                                        12</span>\n\n   ground that he was won over by the accused. Manjit Singh, Sarpanch\n\n   who is stated to be the last and third eye witness turned hostile.\n\n   Therefore, out of the three eye witnesses' one has become hostile\n\n   whereas the other was not examined at all by the prosecution and we\n\n   have only one eye witness PW-7, who happens to be the brother of the\n\n   deceased. If his evidence is discarded there is no other evidence on\n\n   the basis of which the accused could be convicted.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_35\">It is no doubt true that conviction could be based on the sole testimony of a\n\nsolitary eye witness but in order to be the basis of conviction his presence\n\nat the place of occurrence has to be natural and his testimony should be\n\nstrong and reliable and free from any blemish. <a href=\"/doc/391420/\" id=\"a_20\">In Chuhar Singh v. State\n\nof Haryana</a>, [(1976) 1 SCC 879] this Court held that what is important is\n\nnot how many witnesses have been examined by the prosecution but what\n\nis the nature and quality of evidence on which it relies. The evidence of a\n\nsingle witness may sustain a sentence of death whereas a host of\n\nvulnerable witnesses may fail to support a simple charge of hurt. Since the\n\ncase must stand or fall by the evidence of single witness, it is necessary to\n\nexamine that evidence critically.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_36\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_37\">18.However, when we scrutinize the evidence of PW-7, in the present\n\n   case, we do not find him to be trustworthy and reliable witness for he is\n\n   changing his version frequently. He had given one version in the F.I.R\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                                                    13</span>\n\nwhich is reiterated during the course of investigation before the police\n\nwhereas he had given a totally different version at the time of his\n\nstatement before the court. He had stated in the F.I.R that following the\n\naltercation between the deceased and the accused the deceased first\n\ngave a knife blow. When inquest proceedings took place on the next\n\nday at 7.00 a.m. he stuck to the same version and during investigation\n\nalso he confirmed the aforesaid allegation made by him whereas in the\n\ntrial he stated that the accused first gave two knife blows to the\n\ndeceased and then he tried to commit suicide by giving a knife blow to\n\nhimself.   He had also stated that on receiving those two blows the\n\ndeceased came through the window and fell down on the ground. The\n\nsaid version also cannot be believed for the deceased after receiving\n\nthe injuries could not have gone out of the window unless the door was\n\nopen. The car was allegedly parked with the headlights on and if that\n\nwas so, the key of the car was available in the starting/ignition switch\n\nand, therefore, there was no reason why the said car could not have\n\nbeen driven with the dead body of the deceased and the injured to the\n\nhospital as also to the police station by the said PW-7 and the other\n\nwitnesses allegedly with him at that point of time for it has come in\n\nevidence that the other witness knew driving as he was driving the\n\ntractor.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                                                        14</span><p id=\"p_38\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_39\">19.The prosecution also examined Balbir Singh, PW-8, who stated that he\n\n   is the owner and driver of a taxi and on 15.11.1993 Jarnail Singh hired\n\n   the taxi of Ramtar in his presence and after that Ramtar never returned.\n\n   The deposition of the said witness is also found to be not worthy of\n\n   reliance for he did not produce any registration certificate.     On his\n\n   statement that he was owning a taxi, he later said that he had sold the\n\n   taxi. He also stated in his evidence that he is unable to recollect as to\n\n   where from he had purchased the taxi or to whom he had sold his taxi.\n\n   He also stated in his deposition that he was holding a forged driving\n\n   license. These circumstances make him totally unreliable.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_40\">20.The entire story sought to be put forth by the prosecution and by PW-7\n\n   particularly appears to be doubtful and full of contradictions. It will be\n\n   unsafe to convict a person on the basis of such unreliable and\n\n   untrustworthy evidence particularly when such statements are full of\n\n   embellishment and contradictions, without corroboration in material\n\n   particulars by reliable testimony, direct or circumstantial. Consequently,\n\n   we set aside the order of conviction and sentence passed against the\n\n   appellant and give him benefit of doubt. He stands acquitted of the\n\n   charges. He shall be set free immediately, unless required in any other\n\n   matter.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_41\">21.The appeal is accordingly allowed.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">\f                                                         15</span><p id=\"p_42\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_43\">                   .................................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_44\">                   (Altamas Kabir)\n\n\n                   .................................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_45\">                   (Dr. Mukundakam Sharma)\n\nNew Delhi;\n</p><p id=\"p_46\">January 15, 2009\n\f</p>"}, {"numcites":4,"covertids":[],"covertitles":[],"relatedqs":[{"value":"pasayat","formInput":"pasayat"},{"value":"interpretation","formInput":"interpretation"},{"value":"dumping","formInput":"dumping"},{"value":"arijit pasayat","formInput":"arijit%20pasayat"},{"value":"anti dumping","formInput":"anti%20dumping"}],"firstname":null,"title":"Designated Auth.Min.Of Com.& ... vs Indian Metals & Ferro Alloys Ltd on 27 January, 2009","url":"http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgst.aspx?filename=33556","lastname":"pasayat","secondname":"a","publishdate":"2009-01-27","citedbyList":[],"covers":[],"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","numcitedby":0,"divtype":"judgments","doc":"<div class=\"docsource_main\">Supreme Court of India</div>\n<div class=\"doc_title\">Designated Auth.Min.Of Com.&amp; ... vs Indian Metals &amp; Ferro Alloys Ltd on 27 January, 2009</div><div class=\"doc_author\">Author: .

The Act is intended to benefit the unorganized\n\nworkers in the construction sector.         Under Section 6 of the Act, the\n\nappropriate Government has to appoint registering officers and under\n\nSection 7 of the Act every employer shall register their establishment.\n\nThe building workers are given various benefits and in order to enable\n\nthe workers to avail the benefits, each State has to constitute a State\n\nWelfare Board. The Board shall consist of a Chairman nominated by the\n\nCentral Government, and such other Members, not exceeding 15, as may\n\nbe appointed by the State Government.            The Board shall appoint a\n\nSecretary as its Chief Executive Officer.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                         2</span><p id=\"p_2\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_3\">         Under Section 22 of the Act, the Board may provide immediate\n\nassistance to the beneficiaries in case of accident, and also pay\n\ncompensation to those workers who had completed the age of sixty\n\nyears.     The Board may also sanction loans and advances to the\n\nbeneficiaries and also to give financial assistance for the education of\n\nchildren of the beneficiaries and also to give the benefit of group\n\ninsurance schemes. The Board can also grant maternity benefit to the\n\nfemale beneficiaries. A construction welfare fund has to be constituted\n\nand there are other provisions also to regulate the conditions of service\n\nof construction workers. There are also provisions to take care of the\n\nsafety and health conditions of the workers. In order to implement the\n\nprovisions there shall be inspecting staff and certain penal provisions are\n\nalso in the Act to punish those who act in violation of the provisions of\n\nenactment.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">         The   Parliament   has   also   passed   the   Building   and   <a href=\"/doc/611977/\" id=\"a_1\">Other\n\nConstruction Workers Welfare Cess Act</a>, 1996 for the purpose of levy and\n\ncollection of cess and <a href=\"/doc/1902664/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 3</a> of the Act envisages that- there shall be\n\nlevied and collected a cess for the purposes of the Building and Other\n\nConstruction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of\n\nService) Act, 1996, at such rate not exceeding two percent; but not less\n\nthan one per cent of the cost of construction incurred by an employer, as\n\nthe Central Government may specify for him to time. <a href=\"/doc/611977/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 62</a> of the\n\nBuilding and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                      3</span>\n\n<a href=\"/doc/611977/\" id=\"a_4\">Other Construction Workers Welfare Cess Act</a> says that proper Rules are\n\nto be framed by the Government after consultation with the expert\n\ncommittee.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">             The learned counsel appearing for the writ petitioners filed a\n\nchart before us indicating the steps that had been taken by the various\n\nstate governments.

Though some of the state\n\ngovernments have collected cess but the benefits have not been fully\n\npassed on to the construction workers. Some of the State governments\n\nhave not constituted either the State Advisory Committee or the expert\n\ncommittee or the Welfare Board as envisaged under the Act.       The Delhi\n\nGovernment has framed detailed Rules, namely, the Delhi Building and\n\nOther Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions\n\nof Service) Rules, 2002.   These Rules exclusively deal with the matter\n\nand gives various model forms also for compliance of the provisions of\n\nthe Act. The State Governments and Union Territories which have not\n\nframed the rules as per <a href=\"/doc/611977/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 62</a> of the Act can very well take the Delhi\n\nBuilding and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and\n\nConditions of Service) Rules 2002, as a model and the same can be\n\nadopted for the purpose of this Act.

The District Forum further\ndirected the Authority to pay interest to the respondent at the rate of 15 per cent per\nannum for the period from 1st April, 1995 to 6th September, 1996 on the amount\ndeposited by her up to 31st March, 1995 and Rupees four thousand towards mental\nagony and cost of litigation as, in its opinion, there was delay on the part of the\nAuthority in delivering possession of the house to the respondent. The said order was\nconfirmed in appeal by\n                                                                                  ...2/-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                         -2-</span>\n<p id=\"p_4\">the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, U.P.(for short, \"the State\nCommission\") and when the matter         was taken in revision before the National\nConsumer Disputes Redressal Commission (for short, \"the National Commission\"),\nthe same has been dismissed. Hence, this appeal by special leave.\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">           Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant-Authority submitted\nthat the District Forum was not justified in directing it to remove the defects in the\nhouse allotted to the respondent on the basis of report dated 15th September, 1996\nprepared by the Engineer appointed by her because she had taken possession of the\nhouse without making any grievance regarding the so-called defects. In our view,\nthere is no merit in the submission of the learned counsel and the direction given by\nthe District Forum does not call for interference because the Authority did not adduce\nany evidence before the District Forum to controvert the report produced by the\nrespondent. If the house was free from defects on the date of delivery of possession\nand the Authority thought that report dated 15th September, 1996 does not reflect the\ntrue status of the house, then it could have, on receipt of the notice of the complaint,\ndeputed its own engineer for inspection and submitted report before the District\nForum to convince it that the grievance made by the respondent was untenable.\nHowever, the fact of the matter is that no such report was produced by the Authority.\nTherefore, we do not find any justification to interfere with the direction given by the\nDistrict Forum, which was confirmed by the State Commission as well as the National\nCommission.\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">           Learned counsel for the appellant next submitted that the District Forum\nwas not justified in awarding interest on the amount deposited by the respondent up\nto 31st March, 1995 because there was no delay in the delivery of possession of the\nhouse. Learned counsel pointed out that in terms of letter dated 3rd February, 1993\nthe respondent was required to\n                                                                                   ...3/-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                          -3-</span>\n<p id=\"p_7\">pay balance of the estimated cost by 30th July, 1995 but she did not pay the\ninstalments on due dates and the last one was paid after more than one year and four\nmonths of the delivery of possession. Learned counsel for the respondent fairly\nadmitted that his client did not pay instalments of the balance estimated cost on due\ndates. In this view of the matter, the Authority cannot be blamed for delay in\nhanding over possession of the house to the respondent. Even otherwise, we are\nsatisfied that the finding recorded by the District Forum on the issue of delay in the\ndelivery of possession is based on total misreading of letter dated 3rd February, 1993\nand the pleadings of the parties. The District Forum completely ignored the fact that\nthe respondent had not paid even a single instalment on due date and even as on the\ndate of handing over possession, substantial amount was due from her. A reading of\nletter dated 3rd February, 1993 shows that the respondent was required to pay\ninstalments of the balance estimated costs between 30th January, 1993 and 30th July,\n1995. It was mentioned in that letter that the expected date of delivery of possession of\nthe house would be during the year 1995, which would necessarily mean after\npayment of the instalments by 30th July, 1995. It was further mentioned in the letter\nthat if the house is made ready before one or more instalments are due, then\npossession of the same would be made over to the complainant only upon payment of\nentire balance instalments in one lump sum. In paragraph (4) of the complaint the\nrespondent has given a table of the instalments paid by her. A reading thereof makes\nit clear that not a single instalment was paid within time. Till the year 1994, the\nrespondent paid only a sum of Rupees one lakh. No payment was made in the year\n1995 and substantial amount was paid between the years 1996 and 1998. The last\ninstalment was paid on 16th January, 1998. From these facts it is evident that there\nwere laches on the part of the respondent\n                                                                                    ...4/-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                           -4-</span>\n<p id=\"p_8\">in payment of the instalments. In this view of the matter, it must be held that District\nForum was not justified in awarding interest upon the amount deposited till 31st\nMarch, 1995 and the sum of Rupees four thousand by way of compensation for\nmental agony as also cost of litigation.\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">           Accordingly, the appeal is allowed in part and the impugned order passed\nby the District Forum awarding interest from 1st April, 1995 till 6th September, 1996\nand sum of Rupees four thousand by way of compensation and the orders of the State\nCommission and the National Commission confirming the same are set aside.\nCIVIL APPEAL NO. 6955 OF 2004:\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">           Heard learned counsel for the parties.\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">           By the impugned order, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal\nCommission (for short \"the National Commission\"), has remanded the matter to the\nDistrict Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Ghaziabad (for short, \"the District\nForum\") for calculation of the amount payable to the respondent as also the amount\ndue to the appellant-Authority.

The City Civil Court, Mumbai in a detailed\n\njudgment, came to a finding that the Plaintiff-\n\nAppellant herein failed to show that the suit\n\nstructures    existed    prior     to    datum    line       i.e.\n\nprior to 1962 and no Sanctioned Plan of the\n\nsuit structure was produced before the Court.\n\nThe    documentary     evidence,        produced       by     the\n\nPlaintiff-Appellant was discrepant in that the\n\nAssessment Numbers and the addresses did not\n\ntally.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">4.    Further finding of the City Civil Court,\n\nMumbai was that the Appellant could not produce\n\nany documentary evidence to link the assessment\n\ndocuments with the suit structure and thus the\n\nCourt held that the Appellant failed to make\n\nout    any    prima-facie       case      for     grant        of\n\ninjunction.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">5.    Virtually   on    those    findings,       the    prayer\n\nfor injunction was concurrently refused by the\n\nHigh Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">6.    Apart   from   those   two    proceedings,            other\n\nproceedings were also initiated in respect of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                         2</span>\n\fthe structures in question as would appear from\n\nthe facts discussed below.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">7.     The    Appellant       claims       to     be    one     of    the\n\nowners       of   land      measuring       485     square       yards,\n\nbearing       Survey        No.35,        Hissa        No.1     (Part),\n\nC.T.S.No.688,          situated       at     Saki       Vihar     Road,\n\nKilick Nikason Marol, Andheri (East), Mumbai-\n\n40007       and   a   Chawl       standing      thereon       and    the\n\nAppellant claims that his father constructed\n\nthe same Chawl in the year 1956 and the shops\n\ntherein       were    let     out    to    various       tenants      on\n\nrent.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">8.    One    of   the    tenants          Chetan       Prakash       Jain\n\nreceived      a    notice      under      Section       351     of   the\n\nMumbai Municipal Corporation Act (hereinafter\n\n`the said Act'), from the second respondent who\n\nhad issued the same in purported exercise of\n\nthe powers delegated to him under Section 4A of\n\nthe     Mumbai        Metropolitan         Region        Development\n\nAuthority Act, 1974 (hereinafter `the Act of\n\n1974'). The noticee was asked to show cause why\n\nthe shop in his possession be not demolished\n\nsince it has been constructed in contravention\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                              3</span>\n\fof the provisions of Section 347 of the said\n\nAct.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">9.     That    notice        was        replied     to      by     Chetan\n\nPrakash Jain to the effect that the structure\n\nin question was in existence much prior to the\n\ndate of the notice and hence the same is a\n\ntolerable structure under the said Act and is\n\nnot required to be removed.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">10.     The grievance             of    the     Appellant        is    that\n\nthe     second        Respondent             without     giving         the\n\nnoticee an opportunity of being heard, passed\n\nan order directing him to remove the portion of\n\nthe     structure       to        be    affected       by    the      road\n\nwidening scheme and to hand over the possession\n\nof     the    same     to     the       first     Respondent.          The\n\nfurther grievance is that no such notice was\n\ngiven    to     the    other          tenants    and/or      adjoining\n\nshop owners in the said Chawl.</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">\n\n11.     Thereafter, in the second week of                          March,\n\n2006         some     of          the        officers       and         the\n\nrepresentatives              of        the      Respondent            No.1-\n\n</pre><p id=\"p_13\">Corporation allegedly fixed boundary marks in\n\nand around the said Chawl on the basis that the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                  4</span>\n\farea covered under the said boundary wall would\n\nbe required for the widening of the road.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">12.     The Appellant and the other owners of the\n\nChawl    through       the   notice       of       their    Advocate\n\ndated     22.3.2006       claimed       to     have       placed     on\n\nrecord        correct     facts         and        documents       and\n\ncomplained       against         such    activities         of     the\n\nRespondent.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">13.     The    second     Respondent          while       exercising\n\nthe powers under Section 351 of the said Act\n\ndirected       Chetan     Prakash       by     a    notice       dated\n\n3.4.2006 to remove the suit structure, inter-\n\nalia,     on     the     ground         that       the     same     is\n\nunauthorized and not tolerable.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">14.     Against the said notice, a Writ Petition\n\nbeing    W.P.(L)       No.868      of    2006       was    filed    on\n\n12.4.2006 by the Appellant which was disposed\n\nof on the same very day by the Division Bench\n\nof the Bombay High Court, inter-alia, holding\n\nthat the first Respondent is to give notice to\n\nthe Petitioner No.1 who will accept the notice\n\non behalf of the Petitioners and all co-owners\n\nand     directed    the      first      Respondent          to     pass\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                             5</span>\n\fappropriate order according to law. The Court\n\nmade it clear that the construction shall not\n\nbe demolished without notice and hearing the\n\nPetitioner No.1.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_17\">15.   Thereafter,       the      second     Respondent      on\n\n13.4.2006 sent several notices to the Appellant\n\nand other tenants under Section 351 of the said\n\nAct asking the occupants to vacate the suit\n\npremises and to remove the suit structure.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">16.     The case of the Appellant is that even\n\nthough the said notices were replied to, but no\n\nhearing was given to them nor were they given\n\ninspection of those orders by which the powers\n\nwere delegated upon the second Respondent by\n\nthe first Respondent.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_19\">17.     The    second     Respondent,      it   is   alleged,\n\nwithout hearing the Appellant passed orders on\n\n13.5.06       declaring    the    suit    structure    to   be\n\nillegal       and   directing    the     Appellant    and   the\n\ntenants to remove the construction within seven\n\ndays.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_20\">18.     Challenging the same, the Appellant filed\n\nL.C. Suit No. 2238 of 2006, out of which the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                           6</span>\n\f  present proceedings arise, before the Bombay\n\n  City Civil Court praying for interim order. The\n\n  learned Trial Judge rejected on 19.5.2006 the\n\n  prayer for ad-interim injunction holding that\n\n  the    plaintiff    failed       to   make    out    any    prima\n\n  facie case on any of the grounds urged before\n\n  the Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_21\">  19.    Against     the    said    order,      an    appeal    was\n\n  filed before the High Court and the High Court\n\n  took up the matter for hearing on 18.7.2006 and\n\n  by granting an interim injunction remanded the\n\n  matter to the Trial Court for consideration of\n\n  injunction prayer afresh.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_22\">  20.    Thereafter,       the     Trial    Court     heard     the\n\n  matter and dismissed on 23.8.2006 the prayer\n\n  for interim injunction and the said order has\n\n  been    upheld     by    the     High     Court     under    the\n\n  impugned judgment dated 23.11.2006.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">21.   In the background of these facts, the only\n\nlegal issue which arises is:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">             Whether       the     second      Respondent,      the\n\n         Executive Engineer of Mumbai Metropolitan\n\n         Region Development Authority (hereinafter,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                             7</span>\n\f          the said Authority) is entitled in law to\n\n          issue       notice          dated       13.04.2006       under\n\n          Section     351    of       the     said    Act.        It   was\n\n          further argued since the second Respondent\n\n          has no authority to issue the notice, all\n\n          steps taken pursuant to such notice are\n\n          illegal and should be set aside by this\n\n          Court.\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"p_24\">22. These        questions      have        been     very    adequately\n\ndealt with in the judgment of the High Court. The\n\nHigh Court after considering the provisions of\n\nthe Act of 1974 and specially the amendment made\n\nto   it    in     1989,     came       to     a   finding     that     the\n\nExecutive Engineer can exercise or perform the\n\nfunctions       and    duties         delegated      to     him   by   the\n\nMetropolitan Commissioner.                    The High Court noted\n\nthat provisions for delegation were statutorily\n\nmade. Therefore, notice issued by him cannot be\n\nheld to be illegal.            Those findings have not been\n\nchallenged        before       us      during        the     course     of\n\nargument        and   in    view       of     the    provisions        for\n\nstatutory delegation, which have been noted in\n\nthe judgment of the High Court, we do not think\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                  8</span>\n\f  there       is     any    merit          in     the    aforesaid         legal\n\n  contention.         No other argument is made before us.\n\n  It is well settled when prayer for injunction is\n\n  concurrently refused by two courts, this court,\n\n  in     a    proceeding          under         <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_1\">Article       136</a>     of     the\n\n  Constitution,            will    be       very    slow      and    cautious\n\n  before it can take a different view.                          This court\n\n  can only do so, if it finds that the judgment of\n\n  the court below is perverse.                           In the facts of\n\n  this       case,    discussed            above,       the   court    cannot\n\n  arrive at such a finding.                       Therefore, we do not\n\n  find       any     merit        in       this     appeal,         which     is\n\n  accordingly dismissed.

On account of breach between the parties, disputes and\n\ndifferences had arisen which were referred to the arbitration of\n\nHon.Mr.Justice R.S.Pathak, (since deceased)       Former Chief\n\nJustice of India and Former Judge of the International Court of\n\nJustice (as His Lordship then was). The learned Arbitrator, so\n\nappointed, entered appearance and the arbitration proceedings\n\nwent on till 25th of November, 2005 when the learned Arbitrator\n\nby an order dated 25th of November, 2005 resigned and had\n\nwithdrawn as Arbitrator from the arbitration stating that as the\n\nissues involved in the arbitration were similar to the issues\n\ninvolved in an earlier award passed by him and, therefore, it\n\nwas thought fit that he should withdraw from the arbitration.\n\nAt this juncture, we may examine the arbitration clause which\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                                                  5</span>\n\n\nis enumerated in clause 16 of the tender, as noted herein\n\nbefore. From a plain reading of the arbitration clause, it is\n\nevident that for the purpose of appointing the sole Arbitrator,\n\nthe Chief Managing Director of the respondent, i.e. NALCO who\n\nshall be the appointing authority will send within 30 days of\n\nreceipt of the notice of the seller a panel of three names of\n\npersons. It will also be evident from the said arbitration clause\n\nthat the contractor shall on receipt of the names, as referred,\n\nselect any one of the persons' named to be appointed as a sole\n\nArbitrator and communicate his name to the appointing\n\nauthority who shall thereupon appoint the said person as sole\n\nArbitrator. This clause further provides that if the seller fails to\n\ncommunicate such selection, as noted above, within the period\n\nspecified, the appointing authority shall make the selection and\n\nappoint the selected person as the sole Arbitrator. An over all\n\nlook of the aforesaid provision of the arbitration clause makes it\n\nclear that the appointing authority for appointment of an\n\nArbitrator under the arbitration clause is the Chief Managing\n\nDirector of the respondent who shall send a notice to the\n\npetitioner within 30 days of receipt of a panel of three names. It\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                                                 6</span>\n\n\nwould be obligatory on the part of the petitioner to select any\n\none of the persons' named by the appointing authority to be\n\nappointed as the sole Arbitrator and communicate his name to\n\nthe   appointing   authority   and   thereupon    the   appointing\n\nauthority shall appoint the said person as the sole Arbitrator. If\n\nthe seller fails to communicate such selection as provided\n\nabove within the period specified, the appointing authority shall\n\nmake the selection and appoint the selected person as the sole\n\nArbitrator. On the resignation of the sole Arbitrator, namely,\n\nHon.Mr.Justice R.S.Pathak, (since deceased) in terms of the\n\naforesaid clause, a list of three names were admittedly served\n\nupon the petitioner out of which one was to be selected for\n\nappointment in replacement of Hon.Mr.Justice R.S. Pathak,\n\n(since deceased). It is not in dispute that the said notice was\n\nduly served on the petitioner, but in spite of such service of\n\nnotice, the petitioner had failed to appoint or select any one of\n\nthe persons named in the panel of three persons from the list\n\nsent by the respondent within the time specified therein. Since\n\nthe arbitration clause clearly provides for selection of one of the\n\npersons named in the panel to be appointed as the sole\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                                                  7</span>\n\n\nArbitrator by the respondents, it was open for the respondent\n\nto select one persons' named from the panel and appoint as the\n\nsole Arbitrator. In this case admittedly the respondent has\n\nalready appointed and selected a retired Judge of the Delhi\n\nHigh Court as the sole Arbitrator to replace Justice R.S.Pathak\n\n(since deceased). After such appointment having been made,\n\nthe petitioner has filed this application saying that since the\n\nformer Chief Justice of India was appointed as the sole\n\nArbitrator, it would not be possible for the petitioner to accept a\n\nretired Judge of the Delhi High Court for being appointed as\n\nthe sole Arbitrator. As noted herein above, it is not in dispute\n\nthat a panel of three persons in compliance with the arbitration\n\nclause was sent by the respondent which was duly received by\n\nthe petitioner. In spite of receipt of the said notice to select any\n\none of the persons named in the panel and the petitioner\n\nhaving failed to select or choose any one of them and had\n\nstarted saying that as a former Chief Justice of India was\n\nappointed to arbitrate the disputes between the parties, the\n\nquestion of accepting a retired Judge of the High Court as the\n\nsole Arbitrator in replacement of a former Chief Justice of India\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                                               8</span>\n\n\nwas not acceptable to the petitioner. We are unable to accept\n\nthe submissions made by Mr.Ganguly, learned senior counsel\n\nappearing on behalf of the petitioner and after going through\n\nthe arbitration clause in depth and in detail, in my view, it was\n\nopen to the respondent to select any one from the panel sent by\n\nthe respondent after the expiry of the period for selecting a\n\nperson by the petitioner. In this case, since the respondent has\n\nalready exercised the arbitration clause and already replaced\n\nand selected a sole arbitrator in place of Justice R.S.Pathak\n\n(since deceased) who has already entered appearance, I do not\n\nfind any reason to replace the appointed arbitrator at this stage\n\nwhen admittedly no allegations have been put forward by the\n\npetitioner against such appointment excepting that since a\n\nformer Chief Justice of India was appointed to arbitrate the\n\ndisputes between the parties, this time also a former Chief\n\nJustice of India ought to have been appointed.         As noted\n\nherein earlier, a plain reading of the arbitration clause would\n\nclearly show that it was solely on the respondent to select the\n\nperson from the panel of three persons in the event the\n\npetitioner had failed to select any one of the persons named by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                                                9</span>\n\n\nthe respondent. In view of the aforesaid admitted fact and in\n\nview of the fact that the arbitration clause was very clear, it\n\nwould not be necessary for me to go into the details in this\n\nmatter as I find that the appointment was already made and it\n\nis only a case of replacement of earlier sole arbitrator on the\n\nground of his resignation. Therefore, the objections raised by\n\nMr.Ganguly, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner\n\ncannot be sustained at this stage particularly when the\n\npetitioner has not raised any objection on the creditability of\n\nthe sole arbitrator now appointed by the respondent.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">3.   It is to be kept on record that although comprehensive\n\nsubmissions were filed by both the parties before me, but in\n\nview of the admitted fact, as stated hereinabove and on a plain\n\nreading of the arbitration clause itself I do not find any\n\njustification to deal with the submissions put forward by the\n\nparties. I, however, request the sole arbitrator to start with the\n\narbitration at an early date and it is expected that he will pass\n\nthe award in accordance with law within six months from the\n\ndate of supply of a copy of this order to him.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                                                   10</span>\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">4.        For the reasons aforesaid, I do not find any ground to\n\nallow this application and accordingly the application is\n\nrejected. There will be no order as to costs.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">                                                    ..................\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">.....J.\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">                                                [Tarun\nChatterjee]\n\n          New Delhi;\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">          January 20, 2009.\n</p>\f","tid":921698,"showurl":true,"citeList":[{"tid":1306164,"url":null,"title":"THE ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION ACT, 1996"},{"tid":596725,"url":null,"title":"Section 11 in The Arbitration Act,   1940"}]}, {"numcites":1,"covertids":[],"covertitles":[],"relatedqs":[{"value":"national commission","formInput":"national%20commission"}],"firstname":null,"title":"Krishna Singh & Anr vs L.I.C.

This appeal is directed against the Judgment and order\n\n     dated 31st of August, 2006 passed by the High Court of\n\n     Judicature at Bombay in Family Court Appeal No. 15 of\n\n     2006, by which the decree passed by the Family Court at\n\n     Pune, granting divorce under Section 13(1) (1-a) of the\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/590166/\" id=\"a_1\">Hindu Marriage Act</a>, 1955 was affirmed but had\n\n     remanded the matter back to the Family Court for proper\n\n     determination of issues of permanent alimony and\n\n     ownership of flat in Triveni Nagar. Against the aforesaid\n\n     order of remand, the husband/appellant had filed a\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                            1</span>\n\f     Special Leave Petition, which on grant of leave, was\n\n     heard in presence of the learned counsel for the parties.\n\n     It is to be noted that while issuing notice on this Special\n\n     Leave Petition on 12th of March, 2007, this Court passed\n\n     the following order :-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">           \"Delay condoned.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">           Issue notice.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">           Learned counsel for the petitioner states\n           that he does not challenge the finding on\n           divorce and monthly maintenance.\"\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"p_3\">3.   The issues that were framed by the impugned Judgment\n\n     of the High Court are as follows :-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">     \"(a) Whether the original petitioner will in law\n     be entitled to seek declaration as prayed for from\n     Family Court under Family Court's Act?\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">     (b) If yes, whether in the facts and circumstances\n     of this case, the original petitioner should be given\n     such declaration of Family Court or any other\n     order as Family Court may deem fit?\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">     (c) Whether Family Court can record any finding\n     about flat at Mhatre Bridge and Triveni Nagar in\n     the absence of Narhari alias Kishor, father of the\n     appellant?\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">     (d) Whether in facts and circumstances of the case,\n     the original petitioner proves that flat at Mhatre\n     Bridge and Triveni Nagar were/are owned by the\n     appellant?\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">     (e) What should be the amount of permanent\n     alimony in the facts and circumstances of this\n     case?\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                              2</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">\f4.    Considering the issues framed by the High Court, we find\n\nthat the question of jurisdiction of the Family Court has to be\n\ntaken into consideration by it and that being the position, at this\n\nstage, we are not inclined to interfere with the order passed by\n\nthe High Court. However, we make it clear that the Family\n\nCourt shall not be influenced by any of the observations made\n\nby the High Court in the impugned Judgment while deciding\n\nthe issues as directed by the High Court and the Family Court\n\nshall decide the same in accordance with law including the\n\nquestion whether <a href=\"/doc/320503/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 27</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act, which\n\ndeals with disposal of property is applicable in the facts of this\n\ncase or not.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">4A. However, the amount of Rs. 6,00,000/- (Six Lacs), which\n\nhas been directed to be paid by the High Court to the\n\nrespondent, is stayed till the disposal of the Family Court\n\nproceeding after remand. At the same time, we modify the\n\norder dated 10th of August, 2007 of this Court to the extent that\n\ninstead of Rs. 2000/- as maintenance to each of the child of the\n\nparties, a sum of Rs. 5000/- by way of maintenance to each\n\nchild shall be paid by the husband to the respondent/wife\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                 3</span>\n\fregularly from 1st of February, 2009 onwards or till the Family\n\nCourt decides the disputes after remand.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">     5.

Leave granted.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">2.    Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a learned Single Judge\n\nof the Punjab and Haryana High Court allowing the appeal filed by the\n\nrespondent. The appeal was filed under Section 100 of the Code of Civil\n\nProcedure, 1908 (in short the `CPC'). Appellant as plaintiff has filed a suit\n\nfor mandatory injunction with a prayer that the defendant-respondent be\n\fdirected to ensure possession to him of the demised premises description of\n\nwhich was given in the plaint. He also claimed Rs.3,900/- towards mesne\n\nprofit for use and occupation of the property by the respondent. It was the\n\ncase of the plaintiff that he was the owner of the house and the defendant\n\nwas his cousin and he had inducted him as a licensee in two rooms.\n\nThereafter, when the defendants started misbehaving, he issued a notice to\n\nhim on 27.9.1991 revoking his licence. Since he failed to vacate the portion\n\nof the house in dispute, mesne profit was claimed and the occupation of the\n\ndemised property was also claimed. The defendant took the plea that the\n\nproperty was exclusively in continuous peaceful possession of the defendant\n\nfor last more than 50 years as its owners without paying rent to anybody\n\nincluding the plaintiff. It was also denied that he was ever inducted as a\n\nlicencee. Five issues were framed by the trial court. It is to be noted that\n\nreplication was filed by the plaintiff.    After considering the evidence\n\nbrought on record it was held that the plaintiff was the owner of the\n\nproperty in dispute but all the issues were decided against him. The issues\n\nwere as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">            1.     Whether the plaintiff is entitled for the relief of\n\n            injunction as alleged in the plaint? OPP.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                        2</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">\f             2.    Whether the plaintiffs entitled to recover Rs.3,900/- as\n\n             mesne profits as alleged in the plaintiff? OPP.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">             3.    Whether the plaintiff has no locus standi to file the\n\n             present suit? OPD.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">             4.    Whether the suit of the plaintiffs not maintainable? OPD.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">             5.    Whether the plaintiff has no cause of action to file the\n\n             present suit? OPD.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">3.    The finding of the trial court was reversed by the First appellate court\n\nand the suit filed by the plaintiff was decreed. When the second appeal was\n\nadmitted, the following question was formulated:\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">             \"Whether the learned lower Appellate Court could\n             reverse the findings without considering the documents\n             Ex.D1, D2 and D3.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_15\">4.    The High Court came to hold that the appeal was bound to succeed as\n\nthe plaintiff has failed to prove his ownership. Mere fact that adverse\n\npossession has been claimed by the defendant paled into insignificance and\n\nno benefit of the same can be given to the plaintiff.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                          3</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">\f5.    In support of the appeal learned counsel for the appellant submitted\n\nthat the approach of the High Court was clearly erroneous. It is not a fact\n\nthat Exh. D1 to D7 were not considered. In fact the trial court observed as\n\nfollows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_17\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">            \"Now coming to with regard of creation of relationship\n            of Plaintiff and Defendant as licensor and licensee\n            between the parties, nothing is stated by the Plaintiff in\n            his pleadings when Defendant was inducted as a licensee\n            in the portion of the House No. 5912-13 whereas in his\n            statement as PW-1 he has stated in the cross examination\n            that Defendant was inducted into the Property as licensee\n            about six years earlier. Whereas from the perusal of the\n            oral as well as documentary evidence produced by the\n            Defendant on the file it goes to show that portion of the\n            house has been coming in possession initially of Ghasi\n            Ram father of the Defendant and after his death in\n            possession of the Defendant since 1931. These facts\n            stand proved from the copy of the resolution of the\n            committee dated 19-8-31 Ex. D-1 vide which application\n            of the Defendant for opening the slaughter house in\n            House N0.5912-13 was rejected. Thus it shows that on\n            19.8.31 father of he Defendant was in possession of the\n            house on 19.8.31. Similarly Defendant has filed a loan\n            application Ex. D-2 before the secretary Punjab Khadi &amp;\n            Village Industries Board, Chandigarh for carrying on a\n            business under the Tanners production Co. Op. Society\n            Ltd. In this house. Central Sales tax receipt Ex. D-3,\n            electricity bills since 1984 on wards in the name of Ghasi\n            Ram Show the continuous possession of the Defendant\n            in portion of the house. It is pertinent to mention here\n            that apart form the bar statement of Plaintiff there is not\n            an iota of supporting evidence of any person from the\n            locality in order to prove that Defendant was inducted as\n            a licenses about 5/6 years earlier. Neither any suggestion\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                          4</span>\n\f               was put to the Defendant in cross-examination regarding\n               the creation of the license about 5/6 years earlier. It is\n               well settled that suggestion not put up on any point to the\n               Defendant regarding the matter in dispute. The claim of\n               the Defendant regarding the denial of the relationship as\n               licensor and licensee is deemed to be admitted.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p_18\">6.    Further it appears that the High Court proceeded on an erroneous\n\nimpression as if the First appellate court has reversed the finding regarding\n\nownership. As a matter of fact the First Appellate Court had concurred with\n\nthe finding.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_19\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">7.    It is to be noted that the High Court's observations regarding non-\n\nconsideration of Exh.D1 to D7 by the trial court, are as follows:\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                      \"Similarly while deciding question of title, trial\n               court has not said a word about the documents Ex.D1 to\n               D7, though D1 and D2 were earlier to the filing of the\n               suit by the respondent in favour of the appellant was not\n               proved on record.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_21\">8.    The quoted portion of the trial court's judgment shows that the\n\nconclusions of the High Court are erroneous.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_22\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                             5</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">\f9.    As noted above the First Appellate Court also held that it was\n\nestablished that the plaintiff is the owner of the property in dispute. The\n\nFirst Appellate Court observed as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">               \"The defendant in the written statement claimed his\n               continuous long possession over the house for the last 56\n               years without paying any rent. Meaning thereby, the\n               defendant has taken a plea of adverse possession. In\n               other words the ownership of the plaintiff stands\n               admitted by the defendant. So from every angle it stands\n               proved that the plaintiff is the owner of the property in\n               dispute.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_24\">10.   Above being the position the High Court has fallen into grave error\n\nby overlooking the aforesaid conclusions and in allowing the second appeal.\n\nIn the aforesaid background we are of the view that the second appeal needs\n\nto be heard afresh by the High Court. The matter is, therefore, remanded to\n\nthe High Court for a fresh consideration in accordance with law.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_25\">11.   Appeal is allowed.

When the matter was taken in appeal, the National Consumer Disputes\nRedressal Commission [for short, `the National Commission'], held that there was\ntotal failure on the part of the respondent in exercising adequate care in analyzing the\nblood which made his wife to go for abortions. Accordingly the National Commission\nawarded compensation of Rupees twenty five thousand together with interest @ 9%\nper annum. Feeling dissatisfied, the appellant has filed this appeal.\n</p><p id=\"p_3\">                                                                                   ....2/-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                          -2-</span>\n<p id=\"p_4\">            Having heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record, we\nare convinced that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the National\nCommission was not justified in awarding meagre compensation of Rupees twenty\nfive thousand. When the National Commission found that the respondent was guilty\nof negligence in analyzing the blood and the wrong report given by him made the\nappellant's wife to suffer two abortions, higher compensation should have been\nawarded to him. In our view, in the facts and circumstances of the case, the ends of\njustice will be met if the appellant is awarded compensation of Rupees one lakh with\ninterest.\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">            Accordingly, the appeal is allowed in-part, the impugned order is modified\nand the respondent is directed to pay a sum of Rupees one lakh by way of\ncompensation together with interest at the rate of nine per cent per annum form the\ndate of passing of the order by the National Commission, i.e., 11th December, 2007, till\npayment is made.

This appeal under <a href=\"/doc/1524736/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 379</a> of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973\n\nread with <a href=\"/doc/927005/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 2(A)</a> of the Supreme Court (Enlargement of Criminal\n\nAppellate Jurisdiction) Act, 1970 is at the instance of three appellants.\n\nAmar Singh, appellant no.3, is the son of Deen Dayal, appellant no.1 and\n\nSmt. Sukhrani, appellant no.2. They were tried for killing Asha Devi, wife\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                       2</span>\n\n\nof appellant no.3 for non fulfilment of their demand for dowry and were\n\ncharged under <a href=\"/doc/295920/\" id=\"a_3\">sections 498-A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/295920/\" id=\"a_4\">304-B</a>, alternatively <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_5\">section 302</a> of the\n\nPenal Code.    At the conclusion of the trial they were acquitted of the\n\ncharges by the 4th Additional Session Judge, vide judgment and order dated\n\nApril 30, 2001 in Sessions Trial no.740 of 1998. Against the judgment of\n\nacquittal passed by the trial court the State of U.P. preferred an appeal\n\nbefore the High Court that was registered as Govt. Appeal no.2998 of 2001.\n\nA Division Bench of the High Court found and held that in the face of\n\nprosecution evidence the conclusion arrived at by the trial court was wholly\n\nuntenable. Accordingly, the High Court allowed the appeal, set aside the\n\nJudgment of acquittal passed by the trial court and by judgment and order\n\ndated September 21, 2005 convicted all the three appellants under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_6\">sections\n\n498-A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_7\">304-B</a> of the Penal Code and sentenced them to undergo\n\nrigorous imprisonment for three years and ten years respectively for the two\n\noffences subject to the direction that the two sentences would run\n\nconcurrently. The judgment and order passed by the High Court is brought\n\nunder appeal to this court by the three appellants.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">2.    Dr. J. N. Dubey learned senior counsel made long and elaborate\n\nsubmissions in support of the appeal. Learned counsel first contended that\n\nin a criminal case the scope of an appeal against acquittal is quite different\n\nfrom an appeal against conviction and sentence. In the former case, if the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                       3</span>\n\n\ntrial court has taken one of the two possible views the judgment of acquittal\n\nwould not warrant any interference in appeal. Counsel further submitted that\n\nthe present case fell under that category and the High Court was in error in\n\ninterfering with the judgment of the trial court and substituting its own view\n\nin place of the view taken by trial court. Next, passing over to the merits of\n\nthe case, Dr. Dubey submitted that on the evidence on record several\n\ningredients of the offence of dowry death remained unproved and since the\n\nprosecution failed to establish all the necessary conditions no presumption\n\nwould arise against the appellants under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 304-B</a> of the Penal Code\n\nand Sec. 113-<a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_9\">A of the Indian Evidence Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">3.    Before examining the submissions made on behalf of the appellants in\n\nany detail it would be useful and proper to state certain facts of the case that\n\nare admitted or are in any event undeniable. Asha Devi, the deceased was\n\nmarried with appellant no.3 in June 1997. Fifteen months later she died on\n\nSeptember 6, 1998. At the time of her death she was living with the\n\nappellants. Her dead body was taken out of a well situate at a distance of\n\nabout four hundred paces from the house of the appellants. Here it must be\n\nstated that her death was not caused by drowning. According to the\n\nprosecution, Asha Devi was killed by the appellants and her dead body was\n\nthrown into the well. The appellants, however, have a different story. Their\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                       4</span>\n\n\ncase is that she had gone to fetch water and while pulling up the pail of\n\nwater she accidently slipped and fell down into the well and died.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">4.    At this stage we may take a look at the medical evidence. P. W.3, the\n\ndoctor holding post-mortem on the dead body of Asha Devi found the\n\nfollowing two injuries\n\n 1: Swelling 3 x 3 cm in front upper part of nose.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\"> 2: Swelling mark 5 x 5 cm on top and middle of head.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">On internal examination he found the following injuries :\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      \"Left parietal bone of head was fractured. Membrane was\n      soiled in blood. There was blood in brain. Bone of nose was\n      fractured. There was 2 ounce clotted blood in nose. There was\n      2 ounce watery fluid in stomach\".\n</blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"p_9\">He opined that death was caused due to coma resulting from head injury. He\n\nstated before the court that the injuries were possibly caused by some blunt\n\nweapon. He found no water in the lungs or the wind pipe. He further said\n\nthat that if there was water in the well then those injuries couldn't possibly\n\nhave been caused (by falling down into it). In cross-examination he said that\n\nboth the injuries could be caused by dashing against two different\n\nprojections; those could not caused by a single projection. Under persistent\n\ncross-examination he further said that as a result of falling from a high place\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                      5</span>\n\n\nwith mouth (Sic. face) facing downward injury no.1 could possibly be\n\ncaused and injury no.2 could be caused by dashing against some stone.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">5.    The medical evidence thus fully corroborates the prosecution case\n\nthat Asha Devi was thrown into the well when she was already dead or was\n\ndying. At any rate she had stopped breathing as indicated by the absence of\n\nany water in her lungs or windpipe.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">6.    In order to reconcile the defence case with the medical evidence Dr.\n\nDubey came up with an explanation. Learned Counsel suggested that in\n\ncourse of her fall in the deep well (water surface in the well was at a depth\n\nof 60-70 ft.) Asha Devi might have smashed her head against the wall of the\n\nwell and as a result she went into coma even before hitting the water\n\nsurface. We are totally unable to accept the submission. According to the\n\ninvestigating officer the mouth of the well was half covered by wooden\n\nplanks and a pulley was fixed over the other open half for pulling up the\n\nfilled up bucket. With that kind of arrangement it is highly unlikely for a\n\nperson to slip and fall down in the well. But even assuming that such an\n\naccident took place no injuries as found on the person of Asha Devi can be\n\ncaused in course of the fall into the water. The investigating officer\n\ndescribed the well in question as a kuccha well, that is to say its inner walls\n\nwere not brick lined. Asha Devi had suffered two injuries, one over her nose\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                       6</span>\n\n\nand the other in the parietal area of the head. The doctor was quite definite\n\nthat the two injuries were the result of two separate blows by some hard and\n\nblunt substance. In cross examination he said that the two injuries could be\n\ncaused by dashing against two different projections; those could not caused\n\nby a single projection. We are completely unable to see Asha Devi falling\n\ndown inside the well and getting her face and head smashed twice against\n\ntwo projections jutting out from the soft clay inner walls without any lining\n\nof bricks. We have no manner of doubt that Asha Devi was first beaten and\n\nthen her body was dumped into the well when she was dying or was already\n\ndead.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">7.      Here, it may be stated that the defence also examined a witness. He of\n\ncourse said that the appellants kept Asha Devi with great love and affection\n\nand further that she died due to an accidental fall into the well. He himself\n\nsaw her slipping while bending down to pull up the bucket full of water and\n\nfalling into the well head downwards. The witness has no value in our eyes\n\nand Dr. Dubey too rightly did not even refer to his evidence. As a matter of\n\nfact the defence witness did not make any statement before the investigating\n\nofficer and was examined for the first time before the trial court. It also\n\nappears from the materials on record that the appellants' village where the\n\noccurrence took place belonged to the people of one and the same caste.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                      7</span>\n\n\nDuring investigation the co-villagers tried to conceal the facts and no one\n\nwas prepared to give any statement against the appellants.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">8.      Thus on the evidence on record we find it fully established that only\n\nafter fifteen months of her marriage and while she was living with the\n\nappellants Asha Devi died under circumstances that were not only far from\n\nnormal but also plainly indicated homicide.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">9.      At this stage Dr. Dubey submitted that though Asha Devi might have\n\ndied under abnormal circumstances within seven years of her marriage,\n\nthere was no evidence of any demand for dowry by the appellants or her\n\nbeing    subjected to cruelty or harassment by the appellants for or in\n\nconnection with the demand for dowry. In any event, there was absolutely\n\nno evidence that any demand for dowry was made soon before her death on\n\nSeptember 6, 1998 and the demand for dowry and the cruelty or harassment\n\nmeted out to her in connection with the demand were the proximate cause of\n\nher death. In support of the submission that the appellants did not make any\n\ndemand for dowry Dr. Dubey heavily relied on certain sentences picked out\n\nfrom the evidence of PW 1, the father of the deceased. Learned counsel\n\nreferred to two sentences from the statement of PW 1 in reply to the court's\n\nquestions where he said that no dowry was decided at the time of the\n\nmarriage and appellant no.1 had said that he would be happy with whatever\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                      8</span>\n\n\nthey gave. Learned counsel then pointed out two or three sentences from his\n\ncross examination where he said that there was no talk of dowry at the time\n\nof engagement and marriage of his daughter; there was no talk of dowry at\n\nthe time of solemnization of marriage (taking steps around the sacred fire).\n\nAnd that the appellants took his daughter happily and at the time of\n\ndeparture also there was no talk (of dowry).\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">10.   We find absolutely no substance in the submission. The evidence of\n\nthe witness has to be taken as a whole and not by plucking out one or two\n\nsentences from here and there. In his examination-in-chief PW 1 clearly\n\nstated that in the marriage of his daughter he gave dowry according to his\n\ncapacity but the members of the bridegroom side were not satisfied. Asha\n\nDevi's husband Amar Singh (appellant No.3), father-in-law Deen Dayal\n\n(appellant No.1) and mother-in-law Sukhrani (appellant No.2) used to\n\ndemand Rs.10, 000/- and a chain of gold in addition to what was already\n\ngiven by him. They had made the demand from him. They had also made\n\nthe demand of dowry from his son when he went to their place for bringing\n\nback Asha Devi. The appellant used to beat and abuse her for the sake of\n\ndowry. When Asha Devi used to come to their house she would tell them\n\nthat her in-laws demanded Rs.10, 000/- and a chain of gold and if the money\n\nand the chain were not given then they would arrange a second marriage of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                     9</span>\n\n\nAmar Singh. In July 1998, Deen Dayal (appellant no. 3) had come to his\n\nhouse for taking his daughter. Then too he had demanded Rs.10, 000/- and\n\nthe gold chain. He (the witness) had nothing to give; therefore, he could not\n\ngive anything. Deen Dayal became annoyed and took away his daughter\n\nAsha Devi with him in angry mood.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">11.   Dr. Dubey has referred to two sentences in the statement of PW 1 in\n\nreply to the court questions. In reply to the court questions PW 1 indeed\n\nsaid that at the time of marriage no dowry was decided and the father-in-law\n\nof his daughter had said that he would be happy with whatever they gave.\n\nBut in the very next sentence he said that after six days of marriage they\n\nbrought back Asha Devi from her matrimonial home and then his daughter\n\ntold them that his mother-in-law had been beating her and demanding\n\nRs.10, 000/-. He further said that after three to four months of marriage he\n\nwent to the matrimonial home of her daughter. He had told them (the\n\nappellants) not to make (any further) demand of dowry as he was not in a\n\nposition to give them anything. But the father-in-law of his daughter told\n\nhim that they would not keep his daughter in their house. Similarly, in his\n\ncross-examination he said that there was no talk of dowry either at the time\n\nof engagement or at the time of solemnization of marriage and the\n\nappellants took his daughter happily but again the next sentence is that at\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                     1</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                     0</span>\nthe time of departure Deen Dayal had refused to take food and he had\n\ndemanded dowry. The deposition of PW 1 is full of the assertion about the\n\nappellants demanding rupees ten thousand and a gold chain in dowry and\n\nsubjecting her daughter Asha Devi to cruelty and harassment due to non\n\nfulfilment of their demand.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_17\">12.   Further, the evidences of PW 2 and PW 5, the brother and the mother\n\nrespectively of the deceased, leave no room for doubt in regard to the\n\ndemand of dowry by the appellants and their subjecting Asha Devi to\n\ncruelty and harassment in connection with the demand. From the\n\nprosecution evidence the picture comes out vivid and clear that in addition\n\nto what was given to them the appellants demanded Rs.10, 000/- and a gold\n\nchain. PW 5 stated before the court as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      \"At the time of marriage, Amar Singh had demanded\n      chain of gold for himself and rupees ten thousand for his\n      father. After that the demand was repeated many times.\"\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"p_18\">She further stated:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      \"Two months before death of Asha Devi, Deen Dayal\n      father-in-law of Asha Devi had come to our house for\n      taking her. Deen Dayal had demanded chain of gold for\n      his son and rupees ten thousand and he had asked to send\n      Asha Devi. My daughter was not prepared to go. But\n      we made her to comprehend and then she was sent.\n      Deen Dayal took Asha Devi with him in anger.\"\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                     1</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                     1</span>\n<p id=\"p_19\">The evidence on record fully establishes that there was a persistent demand\n\nof dowry by the appellants and they subjected Asha Devi to cruelty and\n\nharassment in connection with the demand and eventually beat her to death\n\ndue to its non-fulfilment.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_20\">13.   Dr. Dubey lastly contended that before any presumption may be\n\ndrawn against the appellants it must be shown that they had made the\n\ndemand for dowry and in that connection subjected Asha Devi to cruelty\n\nand harassment `soon before her death'. He submitted that according to the\n\nprosecution evidence the demand for dowry was last made in July 1998\n\nwhen appellant no.1 had gone to bring Asha Devi from her parents' house\n\nand she died on September 6, 1998. Thus, according to Dr Dubey, there was\n\nno evidence that she was subjected to any cruelty or harassment soon before\n\nher death and hence, there would be no application of <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 304-B</a> of the\n\nPenal Code and no presumption could be raised against the appellants as\n\nprovided under <a href=\"/doc/294349/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 113-A</a> of the Evidence Act. In support of the\n\nsubmission he relied upon a very large number of decisions but we see no\n\nneed to refer to those decisions as in the facts of the case the submission\n\nappears to us to be completely unacceptable.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_21\">14.     The words `soon before her death' occurring in <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_12\">section 304</a> B of the\n\nPenal Code are to be understood in a relative and flexible sense. Those\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                       1</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                       2</span>\nwords cannot be construed as laying down a rigid period of time to be\n\nmechanically applied in each case. Whether or not the cruelty or harassment\n\nmeted out to the victim for or in connection with the demand of dowry was\n\nsoon before her death and the proximate cause of her death, under abnormal\n\ncircumstances, would depend upon the facts of each case. There can be no\n\nfixed period of time in this regard. From the evidence on record, it is clear\n\nthat there was an unrelenting demand for dowry and Asha Devi was\n\npersistently subjected to cruelty and harassment for and in connection with\n\nthe demand. Both her parents and her brother (PW 1, PW 5 and PW 2)\n\ndeposed before the court that appellant no.1 had once again raised his\n\ndemand when he had gone to their house in July 1998 to bring Asha Devi to\n\nhis place. Their inability to meet his demand had caused him annoyance and\n\nanger. Asha Devi was naturally apprehensive and was very reluctant to go\n\nwith him. But they somehow prevailed upon her and made her depart with\n\nhim. There is thus direct and positive evidence of her being subjected to\n\nharassment. There is nothing to show that after she was brought to the\n\nappellants' place and till her death on September 6, 1998 merely about two\n\nmonths later the situation had radically changed, the demand of dowry had\n\nceased and relations had become cordial between the deceased and the three\n\nappellants. In the facts and circumstances of the case, we are satisfied that in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">\f                                        1</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                        3</span>\nconnection with the appellants' demand for dowry Asha Devi was subjected\n\nto cruelty and that was the proximate cause of her homicidal death.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">15.      We are satisfied that all the ingredients of <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 304-B</a> of the Penal\n\nCode are fully satisfied and on the evidence on record no other view is\n\npossible but to hold that the three appellants are guilty of committing dowry\n\ndeath.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_23\">16.      In view of the discussions made above, it follows that the view taken\n\nby the trial court was completely untenable and the High Court was fully\n\njustified in reversing its verdict in appeal preferred by the State. We thus\n\nfind no merit and substance in any of the submissions made on behalf of the\n\nappellants. The appeal fails and is accordingly dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_24\">                                             .....................................J.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_25\">                                             [Lokeshwar Singh Panta]\n\n\n\n                                             .....................................J.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_26\">                                             [Aftab Alam]\n\nNew Delhi,\n\nJanuary 07, 2009.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">\f1</span><p id=\"p_27\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">4</span>\n\f</p>"}, {"numcites":9,"covertitles":[],"relatedqs":[{"value":"tea","formInput":"tea"},{"value":"section 304(a) and 304 part ii","formInput":"section%20304%28a%29%20and%20304%20part%20ii"},{"value":"section 304 part ii","formInput":"section%20304%20part%20ii"},{"value":"304 part ii","formInput":"304%20part%20ii"},{"value":"304 part i","formInput":"304%20part%20i"},{"value":"pasayat","formInput":"pasayat"},{"value":"section 304 part ii ipc","formInput":"section%20304%20part%20ii%20ipc"},{"value":"304 ipc part ii","formInput":"304%20ipc%20part%20ii"},{"value":"304 ipc part ii of ipc","formInput":"304%20ipc%20part%20ii%20of%20ipc"},{"value":"arijit pasayat","formInput":"arijit%20pasayat"}],"citeList":[{"tid":1560742,"url":null,"title":"Section 302 in The Indian Penal Code"},{"tid":53524,"url":null,"title":"The Salt Cess Act,   1953"},{"tid":1569253,"url":null,"title":"The Indian Penal Code"},{"tid":409589,"url":null,"title":"Section 304 in The Indian Penal Code"},{"tid":724142,"url":null,"title":"Section 324 in The Indian Penal Code"}],"covers":[],"title":"Baskar @ Kannan vs State Of T.Nadu on 20 January, 2009","publishdate":"2009-01-20","divtype":"judgments","citedbyList":[],"tid":1871920,"showurl":true,"covertids":[],"firstname":null,"lastname":"pasayat","numcitedby":0,"secondname":"a","docsource":"Supreme Court of India","url":"http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgst.aspx?filename=33524","doc":"<div class=\"docsource_main\">Supreme Court of India</div>\n<div class=\"doc_title\">Baskar @ Kannan vs State Of T.Nadu on 20 January, 2009</div><div class=\"doc_author\">Author: .

Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the\n\nMadras High Court upholding the conviction of the appellant for offence\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 304</a> Part II of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in\n\nshort the `<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a>'). The accused persons are described as A-1, A-2 etc. as\n\ndescribed by the Trial Court. A-1 by the impugned judgment of the High\n\nCourt was held guilty of offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 302</a> IPC, while\n\fA-2 to A-7 including the present appellant were found guilty under Section\n\n304 Part II, <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_4\">IPC</a> and each was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment\n\nfor five years.

A-1 to A-7 were\n\nacquitted of the other charges leveled against them. A-9 and A-10 were\n\nacquitted of the charges levelled against them. Fifteen persons faced trial,\n\nout of whom the trial Court acquitted A-8, A-11 to A-15. By the impugned\n\njudgment, as noted above, the High Court directed acquittal of A-9 and A-\n\n</p><p id=\"p_4\">10.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">2.    The prosecution version as unfolded during trial is as follows:\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">      PW-1 is the native of Thugli Periyar Nagar. PWs 2, 3, 4 5 and 6 all\n\nbelonged to the same place. PWs 2, 3 and 4 were originally employed in\n\nAmbika Sugar Mills, Kottur. P.Ws. 6 and 7 are also the residents of the said\n\nplace and all were carrying on agricultural operations. P.W.8 belonged to\n\nkealathur village, where he was serving as village menial. P.W.9 belonged\n\nto Keezhasuriya Moolai village, where he was serving as village assistant\n\ncommunity. A-1 to A-11 and A-13 to A-15 belong to Hindu Padayachi out\n\nof whom, A-1 and A-2, though belonged to Hinduism originally, switched\n\nover to Muslim faith. A-12 belonged to another community. P.Ws. 1 to 4\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                        2</span>\n\fbelonged to scheduled caste and they were all employed at the time of\n\noccurrence under one Bhaskar.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">     On 26.3.2001 at about 5.00 p.m., after finishing work, P.Ws. 1 to 4\n\ncame out of the sugar factory and went to a nearby tea stall for taking tea. At\n\nthat time, A-1 was plying auto on the road. On seeing sugarcane on the\n\nroad, P.Ws. 1 to 4 were able to proceed on the middle of the road. When A-\n\n1 came nearby he uttered \"you add four more persons and lie on the road\".\n\nIn reply, P.W.1 told him \"on hearing the horn of the Auto, we gave way and\n\neven then, why are you scolding\". There arose a quarrel. In that, A-1 took\n\ncasurine stick and tried to attack P.W.1. The other witnesses, namely P.Ws.\n\n2 to 4 held the accused and stopped him from attacking. This was also\n\nwitnessed by Thangeraj (hereinafter referred to as deceased), who was\n\ntaking tea in a nearby tea stall. He suddenly intervened and pacified them.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">     A-1 turned the Auto and took the same to Keezhasuriyamoolai village.\n\nP.Ws. 1 to 4 went to Muniyendi Vilas for taking tea. Forty five minutes\n\nlater, at about 6.00 p.m., when the witnesses along with Thangaraju were at\n\nthe place of occurrence, A-l, A-2, A-4 to A-6 armed with aruvals, A-3\n\narmed with an iron road and A-7 armed with a knife and the other accused\n\narmed with casurina sticks, came there. The deceased Thangaraju tried to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                           3</span>\n\fpacify them. A-1 cut the deceased on the left side of the neck. Again A-1 cut\n\nthe deceased below the left ear. A-4 cut him on the left side of the hip. A2\n\ncut him with aruval on the left shoulder. A-5 cut the deceased on the waist.\n\nA-7 stabbed him with the knife on the left armpit and the deceased fell\n\ndown. A-3 beat PW-1 on the head with the iron rod. A-4 cut P.W.1 on the\n\nleft waist. The rest of the accused surrounded P.W.1 and cut P.W.1 on the\n\nright arm, left shoulder, right thigh and on the back respectively and they\n\nfled away from the place of occurrence.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">      One Mohan took P.W.1 to the Government Hospital, Kumbakonam,\n\nwhere he was admitted by P.W.10, the Doctor, at about 7.00 p.m. He issued\n\nEx.P.11, the wound certificate.

On receipt of the\n\nintimation on 26.3.2001 at 1930 hours, P.W.16, the Sub Inspector of Police\n\nproceeded to the Government Hospital, Kumbakonam at 2030 hours. He\n\nrecorded the statement of P.W.1, which was marked as Ex.P.1, on the\n\nstrength of which a case came to be registered in Crime No. 72 of 2001\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_6\">Sections 147</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_7\">148</a>, <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_8\">324</a>, <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_9\">307</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_10\">302</a> IPC and Section 3(2)(v) of\n\nSC/<a href=\"/doc/53524/\" id=\"a_11\">ST Act</a>.

He\n\nprepared Ex.P.2, the observation mahazar and Ex.P.35, the rough sketch. He\n\nconducted inquest on the dead body of the deceased in the presence of the\n\nwitnesses and panchayatdars and prepared Ex.P.35, the inquest report.\n\nFollowing the same, the dead body was sent to the Government Hospital,\n\nThiruvidaimarudur for the purpose of post-mortem.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">      The autopsy of the dead body was conducted. During investigation\n\nA-5 gave confessional statement voluntarily and the same was recorded in\n\nthe presence of witnesses. Following the same A-5 produced five aruvals,\n\none iron rod and one knife in the presence of witnesses. After completion\n\nof investigation, charge sheet was filed. Since the accused persons pleaded\n\ninnocence trial was held. Prosecution examined 20 witnesses. As noted\n\nabove, the trial Court found the appellants to be guilty and awarded\n\npunishments.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                       5</span>\n\f      Before the High Court the primary stand related to acceptability of so\n\ncalled eye witnesses PWs 1 to 4, particular emphasis was made on the\n\nevidence of PW-1 to show that there could not have been a common object\n\nto murder the deceased or attempt to murder PW-1. It was also submitted\n\nthat it is highly unbelievable that twenty persons were involved in such an\n\nattempt. It was, therefore, highlighted that in a group clash PWs 1 to 4 could\n\nnot identify the assailants properly.     The High Court did not find any\n\nsubstance in the stand taken by the appellant. The High Court did not accept\n\nthe stand of the prosecution regarding applicability of <a href=\"/doc/53524/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 302</a> read with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 149</a> IPC. It was held that in respect of the respective acts committed\n\nby each one of them the matter is required to be considered. From the post\n\nmortem certificate it was noticed that the first injury was caused by A-1\n\nwith aruval on the neck and the corresponding injuries caused the death. At\n\nthe same time, A-2, A-4, A-5 and A-6 were armed with aruval, A-7 with\n\nknife and A-3 with iron rod and they have attacked the deceased and\n\ncontributed corresponding injuries. Therefore, it was held that A-1 had to\n\nbe convicted in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 302</a> IPC. So far as others are concerned the\n\nacts attracted <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 304</a> Part II IPC.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                          6</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">\f3.    In support of the appeal, learned counsel for the appellant submitted\n\nthat the High Court has erred in discarding the stand of the appellants before\n\nit. So far as the present appellant is concerned there was no specific role\n\nattributed to him. Therefore, his conviction as maintained by the High\n\nCourt cannot be sustained.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">4.    Learned counsel for the respondent-State on the other hand submitted\n\nthat this is a case where clearly <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 302</a> IPC read with <a href=\"/doc/53524/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 149</a> was\n\napplicable. He however conceded that no appeal has been filed by the State\n\nquestioning the judgment of the High Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_18\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">5.    It is to be noted that PW-1 was not only an eye witness but also an\n\ninjured witness. Merely because PWs 1 to 4 were related to the deceased\n\nthat cannot be a ground to cast a doubt on the authenticity of their evidence.\n\nWhat was required was the closer scrutiny of the evidence. PW-1 has\n\nnarrated the entire incident in Ext.P-1 which was lodged immediately while\n\nhe was admitted in the Government Hospital for treatment. In the Ext.P-1\n\nPW-1 has categorically stated about the presence of A-1 to A-7. He had also\n\nstated that A-1, A-2, A-3 A-4, A-5, and A-6, the present appellant were\n\narmed with aruvals. He had also given a detailed description of the overt\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                          7</span>\n\facts attributable to each one of them, and as to how they attacked the\n\ndeceased. His evidence in Court is to similar effect . The evidence of PWs 2\n\nto 4 is also in similar lines.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_20\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">6.     The High Court noted that after there was a quarrel A-1 went to his\n\nvillage and brought all the accused persons with him. On the facts of the\n\ncase the High Court noted that there was absence of common object. What\n\nwas to be expected was an assault. Accordingly, it was held that A-2 to A-7\n\nwere guilty of offence punishable under Section 304 Part II, <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_18\">IPC</a>. We find\n\nthat the trial Court and the High Court have rightly found the appellant\n\nguilty. The reasoning given by the High Court to find the appellant guilty\n\ndoes not suffer from any infirmity. The appeal is without merit and is\n\ndismissed accordingly.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_22\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">                                                                  ...............................................J.\n                                                                 (Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT)\n\n\n\n       .....................................................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_24\">                                                                 (Dr. MUKUNDAKAM SHARMA)\nNew Delhi,\nJanuary 206, 2009\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                                                                              8</span>\n\f</p>"}, {"numcites":2,"covertids":[],"covertitles":[],"relatedqs":[{"value":"sec 2(1)(d)","formInput":"sec%202%281%29%28d%29"},{"value":"meaning of  \"or' ","formInput":"meaning%20of%20%20%22or%27%20"}],"firstname":null,"title":"Vyavasthapak C.

The appeal preferred against that order\nwas dismissed by the Maharashtra Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission [for\nshort, `the State Commission'], and appellate order has been confirmed by the\nNational Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission [for short, `the National\nCommission].

Respondent No.4 challenged the order\nof the Sub Divisional Officer by filing appeals under Section 8 of the Adhiniyam,\nwhich were allowed by the Collector on the premise that the appellants do not belong\nto weaker section. The Collector observed that the Sub Divisional Officer did not\nconduct enquiry in accordance with Section 6 of the Adhiniyam and held that he\ncould not have nullified the sale deeds on the basis of preliminary enquiry. The writ\npetitions filed by the appellants against the order of the Collector were dismissed by\nthe learned Single Judge who confirmed the finding of the Collector that the\nprovisions of the Adhiniyam are not applicable to the cases of the appellants herein.\nWrit appeals preferred by the appellants were dismissed by the Division Bench.\nHence, these appeals by special leave.\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">           We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. The\nonly question which requires consideration in these appeals is whether the appellants\nfall within the ambit of the expression `holder of agricultural land' as defined in\nSection 2(c) of the Adhiniyam, which reads as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">       \"'holder of agricultural land' in the weaker sections of the people\n       means a holder of land used for purposes of Agriculture not exceeding\n       eight hectares of unirrigated land or four hectares of irrigated within\n       the State whether as a Bhumiswami or an occupancy tenant or a\n       Government lessee either in any one or all of the capacities together\n       within the meaning of the Code.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                                                                         ....3/-\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                        -3-</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">       Explanation.- One hectare of irrigated land shall be equal to two\n       hectares of unirrigated land and vice-versa.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"p_7\">          From a bare perusal of the above reproduced definition, it becomes clear\nthat a person holding land not exceeding eight hectares (unirrigated) or four hectares\n(irrigated) which is used for agricultural purposes, whether as a Bhumiswami or as a\noccupancy tenant or a Government lessee, is covered by the definition of the `holder\nof agricultural land' in the weaker sections of the people. In terms of Section 5, such\nperson is entitled to protection and relief under the Adhiniyam, which has been\nenacted for protecting weaker sections of the people who are often compelled to seek\nloan from private money lending agency to meet their obligations and are coerced to\ntransfer their agricultural holdings for securing repayment of loan. The revenue\nrecords produced before the Court shows that the appellants in civil appeals arising\nout of S.L.P. (C) No.3193 of 2004 and S.L.P.(C) No.12082 of 2004 were holding 1.32\nand 2.57 hectares of land respectively. The Sub Divisional Officer examined the\nrecords and concluded that they are entitled to protection under Section 5 of the\nAdhiniyam because the sale deeds executed by them in favour of Jai Kumar Jain fall\nin the category of prohibited transactions within the meaning of Section 4 of the\nAdhiniyam. While allowing the appeals filed by respondent No.4, the Collector held\nthat the provisions of the Adhiniyam are not applicable to the appellants herein but\nhe did not assign any reason for recording that finding. The Collector also observed\nthat the sale deeds are not vitiated by fraud but while doing so he\n                                                                                  ....4/-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                          -4-</span>\n<p id=\"p_8\">completely ignored Sections 3 and 4 of the Adhiniyam which give overriding effect to\nthe provisions of the Adhiniyam and declare that all prohibited transactions of loan\nas defined in Section 2(f) are subject to the protection and relief under the\nAdhiniyam. The learned Single Judge of the High Court confirmed the order of the\nCollector by relying upon the statement made by the appellants herein in which they\nare said to have admitted that apart from doing agricultural operations, they were\nhaving a shop, floor mill, a motorcycle, buffalos and other animals. In the opinion of\nthe learned Single Judge, the appellants do not belong to the weaker section because\nthey were not wholly dependent on agriculture. The Division Bench simply reiterated\nthe reasoning of the learned Single Judge and dismissed the letters patent appeals.\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">            In our view, the order of the Collector is vitiated by error of law apparent\non the face of the record because while allowing the appeals of respondent No.4, he\ndid not consider the relevant provisions of the Adhiniyam and did not assign any\nreason why provisions thereof are not applicable to the appellants. The observations\nof the Collector that the appellants herein were holding more land is ex facie contrary\nto the revenue records. The learned Single Judge repeated the error committed by the\nCollector and went a step further by observing that the appellants cannot be said to\nbelong to weaker section because they were having a shop, floor mill, motorcycle,\nbuffalos and other animals. Since, the definition of `holder of agricultural land'\ncontained in Section 2(c) does not exclude a person having a floor mill or a shop,\ndismissal of the writ petitions by the learned Single Judge and letters patent appeals\nby the Division Bench only on the ground that the appellants possessed shop, floor\nmill, etc. cannot be sustained.\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">                                                                                        ....5/-\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                          -5-</span>\n<p id=\"p_11\">            Accordingly, the appeals are allowed, impugned orders passed by the\nCollector and confirmed by the High Court in writ petitions as well as in letters\npatent appeals are set aside and the orders passed by the Sub Divisional Officer are\nrestored.\n</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_12\">                                                                         ......................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">\f                    [B.N.

The appellant send\n\nletters demanding payment of instalments which had become due and called upon the\n\nrespondent to enter into a lease deed and take possession of the allotted site. The said\n\nallotment was cancelled on 16.3.1990 on the ground that the respondent had failed to\n\ntake possession.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_2\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_3\">2.        The respondent requested withdrawal of the cancellation and restoration of\n\nthe allotment, vide letter dated 17.3.1990.   By letter dated 19.4.1990, the appellant\n\nrestored the allotment subject to payment of restoration fee and subject to the condition\n\nthat it would be the responsibility of the respondent to take possession and he will not\n\nseek change of plot. The respondent, however, applied for allotment of alternative plot\n\non 15.9.1994, alleging that the municipal authorities had laid a sewer line on the plot\n\nand that some\n\n                                                                                   ......2.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                           -2-</span><p id=\"p_4\">\n\n\n\npart of the plot was also encroached. The appellant thereafter allotted an alternative\n\nplot (Plot No. 6/167, Vaishali) measuring 250.77 sq.mt. on 31.1.1996 and demanded\n\npayment of Rs.3,39,179/- after adjusting Rs.56,820/- which had been paid by the\n\nrespondent towards the earlier allotment. The price charged for the Vaishali site is\n\nstated to be about Rs.1400/- per sq. mt.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">3.        Feeling aggrieved by the said demand, the respondent approached the State\n\nConsumer Disputes Redressal Commission, U.P. seeking a direction to the appellant to\n\ndeliver the Vaishali plot at the original price of allotment which was about Rs.226/- per\n\nsq.mt. He also prayed for damages as also interest on the amount that was deposited by\n\nhim for the Nehru Nagar plot. The State Commission by its order dated 29.3.2001\n\nallowed the complaint. It directed the appellant to deliver the Vaishali plot measuring\n\n250.77 sq.mt. at the original allotment price of Rs.226/- per sq.mt. It further directed\n\nthe appellant to pay interest at 18% per annum on the amount deposited by the\n\nrespondent towards the cost of Nehru Nagar plot.         It also awarded Rs.38,000/- as\n\ncompensation to respondent and also directed the appellant to pay the escalation\n\ntowards the cost of construction of the house, worked out on the basis of cost of\n\nconstruction index in U.P. in the year 1985 and the year of delivery of possession.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">                                                                                      .......3.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                           -3-</span><p id=\"p_8\">\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">4.        The said order was challenged by the appellant before the National\n\nCommission.      The National Commission deleted the direction for payment of\n\ncompensation of Rs.38,000/- and the direction that appellant should pay escalation in\n\nthe cost of construction. It, however, affirmed the direction for delivery of Vaishali plot\n\nat the price of Rs.226/- and the direction for payment of interest at 18% per annum on\n\nthe amount earlier deposited by the respondent in regard to Nehru Nagar plot. The\n\nNational Commission relied on its earlier decision in HUDA Vs. Darsh Kumar (Revision\n\nPetition No.1197/1998 decided on 31.8.2001) for awarding interest at such rate. The\n\nsaid order is under challenge.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">5.        Appellant submitted that the decision of the National Commission in Darsh\n\nKumar has been reversed by this Court in Haryana Urban Development Authority Vs.\n\nDarsh Kumar &amp; Ors., (2005) 9 SCC 449.            The appellant also contended that the\n\ncancellation of allotment in the year 1990 was as a consequence of breaches and was in\n\naccordance with the terms of allotment and the Rules. It was pointed out that as per the\n\nterms of letter of allotment, instalments of Rs.3784.20 had to be paid by the respondent\n\non 4.12.85, 4.6.86, 4.12.86, 4.6.87, 4.12.87, 4.6.88, 4.12.88 and 4.6.89, apart from\n\nexecuting the lease deed and taking possession. It was stated that the respondent did\n\nnot enter into any lease agreement and\n\n                                                                                     .....4.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                          -4-</span><p id=\"p_12\">\n\n\n\ntake possession nor pay the instalments as and when they fell due in terms of the said\n\nallotment letter. It was contended that on account of the delay and breaches on the part\n\nof the respondent in executing the lease deed and taking possession, the plot was\n\nencroached subsequent to the date of allotment leading to unnecessary complications. It\n\nwas submitted that the appellant was entitled to charge the prevailing price for the\n\nalternative plot.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">6.         The respondent denies the allegation of breach by him. According to the\n\nrespondent, the allotted plot was under encroachment even when he went to inspect it\n\nand, therefore, he could not take possession.       He also stated that possession of\n\nalternative site at Vaishali has been delivered to him in the year 2008, when he executed\n\nthe order of the State Commission.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">7.         However, after the matter was argued for some time, the learned counsel for\n\nrespondents on instructions, submitted that to put an end to the controversy,         the\n\nrespondent was willing to pay the prevailing allotment price of Rs.1400/- per sq. mt. in\n\nregard to the Vaishali plot and will not press the claim for interest on the amount paid\n\nfor the earlier allotted site.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_17\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">                                                                                   ......5.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                           -5-</span><p id=\"p_19\">\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">8.        Learned counsel for the appellant is not in a position to give any acceptable\n\nreason to deny the respondent the benefit of the alternative plot that has been delivered\n\nto him, when he is even willing to pay the price demanded. We are of the view that\n\nhaving regard to the factual background, neither party shall be entitled to interest.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">9.        We, therefore, allow this appeal in part and modify the order of the State\n\nCommission and National Commission as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_22\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">(a)       The respondent will be entitled to retain plot No.6/167 at Vaishali measuring\n\n250.77 sq.mt. allotted to him. Consequently, the appellant shall issue necessary letter of\n\nallotment/communication regularising and confirming the allotment.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_24\">(b)       The cost of the said Vaishali plot shall be paid at the rate of Rs.1400/- per sq.\n\nmt. The price calculated at the said rate less the amount already deposited by the\n\nrespondent shall be paid by the respondent to the appellant within three months.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_25\">(c)       A sum of Rs.1,09,160/- is said to have been paid by the appellant to the\n\nrespondent towards interest etc. in terms of\n\n                                                                                        ....6.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                              -6-</span><p id=\"p_26\">\n\n\n\nthe order of the Commission.

No.8261/2007 seeking a direction\n\nto the State of Maharashtra, the appellant and the Deputy Director of Education,\n\nKolhapur Region to close down the V Standard started in the fourth respondent school\n\nand a further direction not to grant any recognition or permission to the fourth\n\nrespondent school to start Standard V Division.      They   also     sought   an   interim\n\ndirection restraining the fourth\n\n                                                                                   .......2.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                          -2-</span><p id=\"p_4\">\n\n\n\nrespondent school from running or continuing the V Standard classes.            The first\n\nrespondent contended that starting of the V Standard classes by the fourth respondent\n\nschool was unauthorised and illegal.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">3.        In the said writ petition, the High Court, while issuing rule on 8.4.2008 issued\n\nan interim direction to the fourth respondent to close down the V Standard and transfer\n\nthe students of V Standard to other schools as per the desire of the students and their\n\nguardians, and issue school leaving certificates to the students to enable them to get\n\nadmissions in other authorised schools. The Deputy Director of Education and the\n\npetitioner were also directed by way of interim order to ensure that the V Standard\n\nclasses opened by the fourth respondent was closed down and the students were\n\ntransferred to other schools. The said interim order is challenged by the appellant\n\nBoard which runs the fourth respondent school.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">4.        We find that the High Court has virtually allowed the writ petition by the\n\ninterim order, that too by an irreversible peremptory direction that the students be\n\nshifted to other schools. The students were not parties before the High Court and they\n\nhave been asked to take school leaving certificates from the fourth respondent school and\n\nshift to other schools. Such a peremptory irreversible step should not normally have\n\nbeen granted by way of interim relief, unless\n\n                                                                                    ......3.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                          -3-</span><p id=\"p_9\">\n\n\n\nextraordinary or special circumstances exist. We find that there are no such special\n\ncircumstances.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">5.        Learned counsel for the first respondent submitted that            the fourth\n\nrespondent was one of the feeder schools for the first respondent school, and if the\n\nfourth respondent runs classes from V Standard onwards, their admission will be\n\naffected. This contention, we are afraid, is not sound. The question is not whether first\n\nrespondent is affected, but whether fourth respondent was doing something which was\n\nillegal and whether the first respondent had any right to complain.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">6.        Primary education is defined in Section 2(15) of the Bombay Primary\n\nEducation Act, 1947 as meaning education in such subjects and upto such standards, as\n\nmay be determined by the State Government from time to time. Primary education,\n\ntherefore, does not mean education from first to fourth standards only, as contended by\n\nthe first respondent.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">7.        The State Government has, in its counter filed before the High Court, clearly\n\nstated that as per the provisions of the Mumbai Primary Education Rule 1949 the\n\nPrimary Education Boards of Municipal Council are empowered to open standards as\n\nnatural growth in the primary schools being run by them, that\n\n                                                                                  ........4.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                            -4-</span><p id=\"p_15\">\n\n\n\nthe Primary Education Board had opened the V Standard classes in the fourth\n\nrespondent school in pursuance of such natural growth and that no permission was\n\nrequired to open V Standard classes as natural growth in schools run by Municipal\n\nBoard. It was further categorically stated that the Board was authorised to open V\n\nStandard as natural growth in the fourth respondent school and that was not\n\nunauthorised or illegal.    We may also refer to the Government Resolution dated\n\n14.11.1979 of the State Government relied on by the first respondent itself which says\n\nthat classes V to VII may either be annexed to secondary schools or to primary schools\n\nrun by local bodies. If that is so, primary schools run by Boards, prima facie, can run\n\nclasses V to VII. Be that as it may. All that we are pointing out is there was absolutely\n\nno basis for the High Court at the stage of admission of the writ petition filed by the first\n\nrespondent to assume that the starting of V Standard by the fourth respondent school\n\nwas unauthorised or illegal and direct closure by way of interim relief.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">8.        We, therefore, allow this appeal, set aside the interim order. The fourth\n\nrespondent school run by the appellant can, therefore, have V, VI and VII Standards,\n\nsubject to the final decision in the writ petition.     We are told that the issue as to\n\nwhether Standards V to VII can be part of primary\n\n                                                                                       ......5.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                             -5-</span><p id=\"p_17\">\n\n\n\nschools, is causing considerable confusion in the State.

This appeal arises out of judgment dated 26.10.2007\n\npassed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Bench at\n\nGwalior, whereby and whereunder the appeal preferred by the\n\nappellant has been partly allowed.        By the impugned\n\njudgment, the learned Single Judge of the High Court altered\n\nthe conviction of the appellant from <a href=\"/doc/261195/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 307</a> of the Indian\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                             2</span><a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">\n\n\nPenal Code</a> (for short `<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_3\">IPC</a>') to <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 324</a> IPC recorded by the\n\nlearned Sessions Judge, Morena, in Sessions Trial No.\n\n190/1999 and sentenced him to suffer rigorous imprisonment\n\nfor 3 years instead of 7 years as imposed by the trial judge.\n\nFine of Rs.2,000/-, out of which a sum of Rs.1,500/- was\n\nordered to be paid to Smt. Shakuntla Bai (PW-4) widow of\n\ndeceased Krishna Sharma, has not been interfered with.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">4.   The incident leading to the prosecution of the appellant\n\noccurred on 20.08.1994 at Village Purawas Khurd, Police\n\nStation Sihoniy, District Morena, Madhya Pradesh. According\n\nto the prosecution, one month prior to the day of the incident,\n\nShri Krishna Sharma purchased a she-buffalo from appellant\n\nRamdas for a consideration of Rs.5,000/-.       It was agreed\n\nbetween the parties that the amount of consideration would\n\nbe paid after birth of calf of she-buffalo. On 19.08.1994, calf\n\nof she-buffalo was born.         On the day of incident, i.e.\n\n20.08.1994, at about 10 a.m. Shri Krishna Sharma went to\n\nthe house of the appellant for the payment of Rs.5,000/-\n\nwhere Sheetal Prasad co-accused was also present. The\n\nappellant made a demand of Rs. 150/- towards interest\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                             3</span>\n\n\namount for which Shri Krishna Sharma did not agree because\n\nthere was no such agreement between the parties to pay the\n\ninterest of Rs.150/-. On this trivial issue, some altercation\n\ntook place between the parties, as a result whereof the\n\nappellant dealt sickle blow on the back of the person of Shri\n\nKrishna Sharma. As a result of the said injury, blood started\n\ncoming from the wound. The incident had been witnessed by\n\nRajaram (PW-2), Ram Kishan (PW-3), Smt. Shakuntla Bai (PW-\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">4) and Ram Swaroop (PW-5).       After causing injury to the\n\nvictim, the appellant and Sheetal Prasad both had fled from\n\nthe scene of occurrence.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">5.   Shri Krishna Sharma, injured, lodged First Information\n\nReport under <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_5\">Sections 323</a>/<a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_6\">324</a>/<a href=\"/doc/555306/\" id=\"a_7\">504</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_8\">34</a> of IPC in the Police\n\nStation against the accused persons, on the basis of which the\n\ninvestigation was conducted by Lal Singh Yadav (PW-8) who\n\nrecorded the statements of the witnesses, inspected the place\n\nof the occurrence and arrested the accused. Shri Krishna\n\nSharma was medically examined by Dr. Jagdish Karkot (PW-7)\n\non the same day who found following injuries on his person:\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                               4</span>\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">             \"One incised wound on the left side back\n             of patient in the size of 1.4 cm x 2 mm x\n             1.3 cm.\"\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"p_9\">6.   Injured Shri Krishna Sharma died on 01.07.1996 (near\n\nabout 2 years after the incident). Therefore, <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 302</a> IPC\n\nwas added in the chargesheet.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">7.   The learned Sessions Judge, on the basis of the evidence,\n\ncharge-sheeted the appellant and the co-accused Sheetal\n\nPrasad under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_10\">Sections 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_11\">34</a> IPC.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">8.   Both the accused pleaded not guilty to the charges and\n\nclaimed to be tried. In order to bring home the charges,\n\nprosecution examined as many as 10 witnesses and placed on\n\nrecord relevant documentary evidence.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">9.   The learned Sessions Judge, on scrutiny of the entire\n\nevidence on record, held the appellant guilty of the offence\n\npunishable   under   <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_12\">Section       307</a>   IPC   and,   accordingly,\n\nsentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 7 years\n\nand to pay a fine of Rs. 2,000/-. Out of the said amount, a\n\nsum of Rs. 1,500/- has been ordered to be paid to Smt.\n\nShakuntla Bai (PW-4), widow of deceased Shri Krishna\n\nSharma. However, no tangible and convincing evidence has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                5</span>\n\n\nbeen found against co-accused Sheetal Prasad, therefore, he\n\nwas acquitted.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">10. Being aggrieved, the appellant filed appeal under <a href=\"/doc/261195/\" id=\"a_13\">Section\n\n374</a> (2)<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_14\"> of Code</a> of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short `<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_15\">Cr.P.C</a>')\n\nbefore the High Court. The learned Single Judge of the High\n\nCourt allowed the appeal in part and altered the conviction of\n\nthe appellant from <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 307</a> IPC to <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 324</a> IPC and\n\nimposed the aforesaid sentence upon him.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">11.   Feeling aggrieved thereby and dissatisfied with the\n\njudgment of the High Court, this appeal by special leave has\n\nbeen preferred in this Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">12.   Having heard Mr. T.S. Doabia, learned Senior Advocate\n\nfor the appellant, this Court issued notice to the State of\n\nMadhya Pradesh confined to the question of quantum of\n\nsentence. Mr. Govind Goel, learned counsel has appeared on\n\nbehalf of the State. Mr. T.S. Doabia, learned Senior Advocate,\n\nstates at the Bar that the appellant has already undergone\n\nabout 15 months of imprisonment in terms of the order of the\n\nHigh Court.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                               6</span><p id=\"p_16\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">13.   On our close scrutiny of the testimony of eye-witnesses -\n\nPWs 2 and 3 and having gone through the First Information\n\nReport (Ex.P/1), it is clear that on the date of the incident, all\n\nof a sudden altercation ensued between the appellant and\n\ndeceased Shri Krishna Sharma on the issue of payment of Rs.\n\n150/- as interest amount. There is no evidence on record to\n\nindicate that there was any previous enmity between the\n\nappellant and the deceased. The appellant is an agriculturist.\n\nUndisputedly, a single blow of sickle had been inflicted by the\n\nappellant on the back of the deceased. Dr. P.R. Pendharkar\n\n(PW-1) conducted an autopsy on the dead body of Shri\n\nKrishna Sharma who as stated above died on 01.07.1996.\n\nAccording to Dr. P.R. Pendharkar, 11 injuries were found on\n\nthe dead body of the deceased, out of which injury no. 10 was\n\nincised wound allegedly inflicted by the appellant on the back\n\nside of the deceased. In the opinion of the doctor, injury nos.\n\n1 to 9 were in the nature of `Ulcers' and indirect outcome of\n\ninjury no. 10.    The opinion of the doctor proves that the\n\ndeceased had not died due to direct result of injury no. 10\n\nsustained by him. It is also pertinent to mention that the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                              7</span>\n\n\noccurrence had taken place on 20.08.1994 and since then the\n\nappellant has been prosecuting the present case for the last\n\nmore than 14 years in various courts and in that process he\n\nundoubtedly has undergone mental agony and financial\n\nsufferings.   In this view of the matter, in our considered\n\nopinion we feel that justice would be sub-served if the\n\nsentence imposed by the High Court, is reduced to the\n\nsentence already undergone by the appellant.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">14.   For the aforementioned reasons while maintaining the\n\nconviction of the appellant under <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 324</a> IPC, the\n\nsentence of 3 years imposed by the learned Single Judge of\n\nthe High Court is reduced to imprisonment already suffered\n\nby the appellant.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_19\">15.   Ramdas-appellant, who is in custody, is directed to be\n\nset at liberty and released forthwith unless wanted in\n\nconnection with any other case.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_20\">16.   With the above modification, the appeal is partly allowed.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">                                   ........................................J.\n                                  (Lokeshwar Singh Panta)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                   8</span>\n\n\n\n\n                        ........................................J.\n                       (B.

It was also submitted that\n\nit is highly unbelievable that twenty persons were involved in such an\n\nattempt. It was, therefore, highlighted that in a group clash PWs 1 to 4 could\n\nnot identify the assailants properly.    The High Court did not find any\n\nsubstance in the stand taken by the appellant. The High Court did not accept\n\nthe stand of the prosecution regarding applicability of Section 304 Part II\n\nread with <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 149</a> IPC. It was held that in respect of the respective acts\n\ncommitted by each one of them       the matter is required to be considered.\n\nFrom the post mortem certificate it was noticed that the first injury was\n\ncaused by A-1 with aruval on the neck and the corresponding injury caused\n\nthe death. At the same time, A-2, A-4, A-5 and A-6 were armed with aruval,\n\nA-7 with knife and A-3 with iron rod and they have attacked the deceased\n\nand contributed corresponding injuries. Therefore, it was held that A-1\n\nhad to be convicted in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 302</a> IPC.

Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a Division Bench of\n\nthe Allahabad High Court allowing the prayer for bail made by respondent\n\nnos.2 and 3 during the pendency of Criminal Appeal No.6724 of 2006.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                     1</span>\n\fChallenge before the High Court was to the conviction recorded by learned\n\nSessions Judge, Bagpat, in Sessions Trial No.299 of 2000. Respondent nos.\n\n2 and 3 were convicted for offences punishable under Section 302 and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 506</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short `<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a>') and each was\n\nsentenced to undergo imprisonment for life and one year for the offences\n\nrespectively. The accused persons were convicted allegedly for committing\n\nmurder of Shiv Kumar. Challenging the conviction appeal has been filed\n\nand simultaneously prayer for being released on bail during the pendency of\n\nthe appeal was filed. By the impugned order the Division Bench accepted\n\nthe prayer and granted bail to the respondent nos. 2 &amp; 3. The High Court\n\nnoted that the allegation was that the incident took place on 8.6.2000 at\n\nabout 8.30 p.m. and accused persons assaulted Shiv Kumar (hereinafter\n\nreferred to as the `deceased') mercilessly with iron rods and he succumbed\n\nto the injuries.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">3.     The only stand taken before the High Court was that the ante mortem\n\ninjuries on the body of the deceased included three contusions, one abraded\n\ncontusion and four lacerated wounds of different dimensions on various\n\nparts of the body which could not have been caused by iron rods. It was\n\ntheir stand that some unknown assailants caused the injuries to the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                    2</span>\n\fdeceased. It was also submitted that by order dated 15.11.2006 the co-\n\naccused has been released on bail.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">4.    The prosecution and the present appellant opposed the prayer for\n\ngrant of bail. It was their stand that PWs 1 and 2 and the informant had seen\n\nthe attacks and were eye-witnesses to the occurrence and PW3 is an\n\nindependent witness. Their evidence has been analysed in great detail by\n\nthe trial Court who found it to be credible and cogent. So far as the\n\npossibility of injuries is concerned, that aspect was also examined by the\n\ntrial Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">5.    After noticing the rival stands, the High Court by the impugned order\n\ngranted the bail with the following conclusions:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                     \"Considering fact and circumstances of the case\n               but without making any opinion on the merit of the\n               appeal at this stage, we are of the view that the accused-\n               appellants Dharmendra and Manoj shall also be released\n               on bail.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_12\">6.    Learned counsel for the informant appellant submitted that the\n\napproach of the High Court is clearly erroneous. After the conviction has\n\nbeen recorded by believing three eye witnesses and also discarding the stand\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                        3</span>\n\fthat some of the injuries were not possible by iron rods, the High Court\n\nshould not have by a cryptic order directed grant of bail. It was, therefore,\n\nsubmitted that the impugned order is unsustainable.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">7.    Learned counsel for the State supported the stand of the informant.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">8.    Learned counsel for the respondent nos.2 and 3 accused submitted\n\nthat it is common knowledge that appeals in the High Court take a long time\n\nfor disposal. A balance has to be struck between the right to speedy trial\n\nand the need for the accused being in custody. The High Court has taken\n\nnote of relevant factors and has granted bail.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">9.    The parameters to be adopted while dealing with the application for\n\nbail by suspension of sentence during the pendency of the appeal has been\n\nexamined by this Court in several cases. <a href=\"/doc/486717/\" id=\"a_3\">In Kishori Lal v. Rupa and Ors</a>.\n\n(2004 (7) SCC 638) it was noted as follow:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">             \"4. <a href=\"/doc/970675/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 389</a> of the Code deals with suspension of\n             execution of sentence pending the appeal and release of\n             the appellant on bail. There is a distinction between bail\n             and suspension of sentence. One of the essential\n             ingredients of <a href=\"/doc/970675/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 389</a> is the requirement for the\n             appellate court to record reasons in writing for ordering\n             suspension of execution of the sentence or order\n             appealed against. If he is in confinement, the said court\n             can direct that he be released on bail or on his own bond.</blockquote><p id=\"p_16\">\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">             The requirement of recording reasons in writing clearly\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                      4</span>\n\f             indicates that there has to be careful consideration of the\n             relevant aspects and the order directing suspension of\n             sentence and grant of bail should not be passed as a\n             matter of routine.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_18\">             5.     The appellate court is duty-bound to objectively\n             assess the matter and to record reasons for the conclusion\n             that the case warrants suspension of execution of\n             sentence and grant of bail. In the instant case, the only\n             factor which seems to have weighed with the High Court\n             for directing suspension of sentence and grant of bail is\n             the absence of allegation of misuse of liberty during the\n             earlier period when the accused-respondents were on\n             bail.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_19\">\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">10.   <a href=\"/doc/500640/\" id=\"a_6\">In Anwari Begum v.

Prosecution version as unfolded during trial is as follows:\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">      Between the intervening night 13.9.1984 and 14.9.1984 Muse Khan\n\n(PW-2), Janu Khan (PW-4), Prosecutrix (PW-5), wife Reshma, Indro (PW-\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">6) wife of Bakhsu Khan, Makhni (PW-7) wife of Sachchu Khan were\n\nsleeping at the house of Bakhsu Khan in village Raivada, accused persons\n\nNeku Khan, Bakhsu Khan, Barkat Khan, Ali Sher and Same Khan arrived\n\non a Nisan vehicle, the accused Barkat was having the iron rod and the other\n\npersons were having lathis, they beat Muse Khan (PW-2) and placed\n\nProsecutrix daughter of Bakhsu in Nisan vehicle forcefully and went away,\n\nthe accused Same Khan shut her mouth with hand and then got down at\n\nGida village with Prosecutrix, for some time walked on foot, after a while\n\nthe accused Same Khan came with a camel and made Prosecutrix ride the\n\ncamel. Another man also rode and Neku Khan, Same Khan and Bakhsu\n\nKhan walked on feet and then took her to the Dadi of the accused, stripped\n\nher clothes and dressed her with new clothes and ornaments and then Neku\n\nKhan did bed work like husband-wife, she stayed there for two nights and\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                    2</span>\n\ffor two nights Neku Khan did bed work with her, thereafter the police\n\narrived there with her father, the accused persons ran away, the police\n\nbrought her to Mandli Police Station.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">      After completion of investigation charge sheet was filed and since\n\naccused persons pleaded innocence they were put on trial.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">      Dr. Mangi Lal Bohra (PW 1) has proved the injuries caused to Muse\n\nKhan on the date of incident by the accused persons while abducting the\n\nprosecutrix. PW-2 is Muse Khan who is brother of prosecutrix and he has\n\ndeposed that he was asleep when he was assaulted. He saw the accused\n\nassaulting his brother and then saw them taking away his sister. The fact\n\nthat Muse Khan was assaulted by the accused, stands corroborated by the\n\nevidence of Doctor who is completely independent witness. Ishaqu (PW 3)\n\nat whose place, the accused is alleged to have kept the prosecutrix. The\n\nprosecution has proved the state of prosecutrix at the place of Ishaqu (PW\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">3). (PW 4) Janu Khan , was also present when the abduction took place. He\n\nsaw the accused assaulting Muse Khan and abducting the prosecutrix. He is\n\nthe person who has lodged the report of the incident to the police. The\n\ntestimony of Muse Khan that he was assaulted and abduction of prosecutrix\n\nis thus corroborated by testimony of Janu Khan. The prosecution version\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                    3</span>\n\frelied primarily on the evidence of Prosecutrix (PW 5). Two witnesses were\n\nexamined by the appellant to show that the victim was married to appellant\n\nno. 1 and therefore there was no rape as contended and no abduction. The\n\ntrial court and the High court did not find any substance in the plea. They\n\nreferred to the evidence of PWs 2,4 &amp; 5 and held the appellant guilty and\n\ndirected conviction and imposed sentence as aforenoted.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">3.    In support of the appeal, learned counsel for the appellant submitted\n\nthat the trial court and the High Court lost sight of the fact that the DWs 1 &amp;\n\n2 categorically stated about the marriage of the victim with appellant No. 1.\n\nThat being so the question of any rape or abduction as claimed does not\n\narise. It is further pointed out that there is no evidence to link the appellants\n\n3 to 5 with the offence.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">4.    Learned counsel for the State on the other hand supported the\n\njudgment of the trial court and the High Court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">5.    We find that there was no evidence of the marriage as claimed. The\n\nevidence of Bhouware Khan (DW 2) on which strong reliance was placed to\n\ncontend that there was a marriage, it did not in fact substantiate the claim.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                      4</span>\n\fBhouware Khan (DW 2) in his cross examination admitted that the Kazi\n\nwrites their nikah. No signature or thumb impression was obtained and the\n\nKazi Yusuf Khan who is claimed to have solemenised the nikah was not\n\nexamined. It is submitted that there is no need for such writing. But in any\n\nevent DW 1 who is claimed to have settled the marriage accepted that same\n\nis the procedure. Thus there was no other material adduced to say that the\n\naccused no.1 and the prosecutrix were married.           That being so the\n\nconviction of appellant No.1 as recorded by the trial court and maintained\n\nby the High Court cannot be faulted.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_17\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">6.    So far as the role played by appellant No. 2 is concerned the same\n\nwas clearly established by the evidence of injured witnesses PW 2 and PW\n\n4, apart from the evidence of the PW 5. That being so the appeal fails so far\n\nas they are concerned.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_19\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">7.    It is rightly contended by learned counsel for the appellants, that there\n\nis practically no evidence to link with the other appellants i.e. Ali Sher,\n\nBakhsu Khan and Barkat Khan with the crime. Their conviction is set aside.\n\nThe bail bonds executed by them shall stand discharged. The appellants 1\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                     5</span>\n\f&amp; 2 Neku Khan and Same Khan shall surrender to custody to serve the\n\nremainder of sentence. The appeal is disposed of in the aforesaid terms.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">                                            ................................................J.\n                                            (Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT)\n\n\n                                           .....................................................J.\n                                           (Dr. MUKUNDAKAM SHARMA)\nNew Delhi,\nJanuary 7, 2009\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                    6</span>\n\f</p>"}, {"numcites":4,"covertids":[],"covertitles":[],"relatedqs":[{"value":"surjit kaur","formInput":"surjit%20kaur"},{"value":"makhan singh","formInput":"makhan%20singh"},{"value":"makhan","formInput":"makhan"},{"value":"kirpan","formInput":"kirpan"},{"value":"bathinda","formInput":"bathinda"},{"value":"kuldip","formInput":"kuldip"},{"value":"substantive evidence","formInput":"substantive%20evidence"},{"value":"recovery memo","formInput":"recovery%20memo"}],"firstname":null,"title":"Mukhtiar Singh & Anr vs State Of Punjab on 20 January, 2009","url":"http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgst.aspx?filename=33521","lastname":"sharma","secondname":"m","publishdate":"2009-01-20","citedbyList":[],"covers":[],"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","numcitedby":0,"divtype":"judgments","doc":"<div class=\"docsource_main\">Supreme Court of India</div>\n<div class=\"doc_title\">Mukhtiar Singh &amp; Anr vs State Of Punjab on 20 January, 2009</div><div class=\"doc_author\">Author: .

Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment and order of the Division\n\nBench of Punjab and Haryana High Court, allowing the appeal filed by the\n\nrespondent State. By the impugned judgment the Division Bench set aside the\n\norder of acquittal passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Bhatinda and\n\nconvicted both the appellants for offence punishable under Section 302 read\n\nwith <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 34</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short `<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a>').            The\n\nappellants-accused were sentenced to suffer imprisonment for life and to pay a\n\nfine of Rs. 10,000/- each with default stipulation.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">2.     The prosecution version as unfolded during the trial is as follows:\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">       A land dispute had been going on between Mukhtiar Singh and his\n\nbrother Babu Singh (hereinafter referred to as `deceased') which had ended in\n\nfavour of the deceased. Mukhtiar Singh was aggrieved thereby. His two sons\n\nGurmail Singh and Harbans Singh had caused injuries to the deceased which\n\nresulted into fracture of his leg and thereafter Harbans Singh son of Mukhtiar\n\nSingh was murdered by deceased and his son Buta Singh.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                         1</span>\n\f      On 15.04.1994, the deceased and his family members which included\n\nhis wife Surjit kaur, son Makhan Singh, daughter-in-law Jasvir Kaur and father-\n\nin-law of daughter of deceased Balwant Singh decided to visit Bathinda jail\n\nwhere the son of the deceased was lodged.          In order to catch a train to\n\nBathinda they reached Kahangarh Railway Station which was next to their\n\nvillage at about 5:00 AM and waited there for the arrival of the Train. Since the\n\ntrain was late from its scheduled time the ticket counter at the Station was\n\nclosed. Except the deceased all had seated themselves on a bench while the\n\ndeceased was standing nearby. In the meantime Mukhtiar Singh armed with a\n\nkirpan and his son Gurmail Singh armed with a takua came there. Mukhtiar\n\nSingh gave two kirpan blows one on the neck of the deceased and another on\n\nhis head. Consequently, he fell down. Immediately thereafter Gurmail Singh\n\ngave blows on the chin, right shoulder, left shoulder and chest of the deceased.\n\nThe family members of the deceased raised an alarm. Mukhtiar Singh accused\n\nexclaimed that they had avenged murder of his son.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">      One SPO Gurdas Singh who was posted on the Assault Post,\n\nKahangarh Railway Station came running and challenged the accused but both\n\nthe accused managed to escape. A wireless message was received in the\n\nrailway station Bathinda at 11:50 AM upon which ASI Gurdip Singh\n\naccompanied by other police officials reached the Kahangarh Railway Station\n\nwhere he found Surjit Kaur, Makhan Singh, Jasvir kaur, Balwant Singh and\n\nSPO Gurdas Singh present. He prepared the inquest report Ex. PC which was\n\nattested by Surjit Kaur and Makhan Singh. Thereafter statement Ex. PM, of\n\nSurjit Kaur was recorded at 5.15 PM, on which he made an endorsement Ex.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                       2</span>\n\fPM/1, upon which formal FIR EX. PM/2 was registered in the concerned Police\n\nStation. The ASI Gurdip Singh went to the spot, lifted the blood stained earth\n\nand put it into a container. After sealing the same, the container was taken into\n\npossession vide recovery memo Ex. PK which was attested by the witnesses.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">      SPO Gurdas Singh also produced a pair of shoes which was taken into\n\npossession vide memos Ex.P.U. and a sum of Rs. 165/- which was recovered\n\nfrom the person of the deceased. A rough site plan Ex.PR of the place of\n\noccurrence was prepared by the Investigating Officer. The autopsy on the\n\ndead body of the deceased was conducted on the next day (16.4.1994) by Dr.\n\nKuldip Rai.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">      Thereafter, Sub-Inspector Hukam Chand arrested both the accused on\n\n20.4.1994. The investigation was taken up by ASI Gurdip Singh and during\n\ninterrogation accused Mukhtiar Singh suffered a disclosure statement Ex.PU\n\nabout concealing of kirpan and blood stained clothes. Thereafter, the accused\n\nMukhtiar Singh got recovered his kirpan and blood stained clothes. Kirpan was\n\ntaken into possessin vide memo Ex.P.U./1 and its sketch Ex.P.U./2 was also\n\nprepared.     The blood stained clothes were also taken into possession vide\n\nseparate recovery memos. Similarly Gurmail Singh accused also suffered a\n\ndisclosure statement Ex.P.V. about concealment of takua and blood stained\n\nclothes.    Thereafter, he also got recovered takua which was taken into\n\npossession vide recovery memo Ex.P.V. and its sketch Ex.P.V./2 was also\n\nprepared. His blood stained clothes were also taken into possession.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">      After the completion of the investigation, challan was filed against both\n\nthe accused and they were charged under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_4\">34</a> IPC. During the trial\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                       3</span>\n\fDr. Kuldip Rai was examined as PW 1, Makhan Singh, son of the deceased\n\nwas examined as PW 2; Surjit Kaur, wife of the deceased was examined as\n\nPW 3; ASI Gurdip Singh was examined as PW 4 and SPO Gurdas Singh was\n\nexamined as PW 5.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">      The trial Court acquitted both the accused of the charges on the ground\n\nthat the testimony of two eye witnesses cannot be believed as the\n\ncircumstances confirm absence of the eyewitness at the place of occurrence. It\n\nwas further stated by the trial Court that the prosecution case was nothing but a\n\ngot up story, knitted after due deliberation between the police and the named\n\neye witnesses. On appeal by the State the High Court set aside the order of\n\nthe trial Court. It held that the trial Court had discarded the testimony of two\n\neye witnesses on feeble grounds and had entertained un-necessary doubts\n\ndespite there being clear and sufficient evidence pointing towards the guilt of\n\nthe accused.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">3.    Mr. Aman Lekhi, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant very\n\neloquently argued that it was a blind murder and the appellants have been\n\nfalsely implicated due to the previous animosity.         While elaborating his\n\nargument he submitted that there was significant delay in giving the information\n\nto the police and that the alleged eyewitness were not present at the time of the\n\nincident and came to the railway station at 3:00 PM only. He submitted that\n\nstory knitted by the prosecution is belied which is established from the very fact\n\nthat before recording the statement of the eye witness who were well present\n\nthere the ASI proceeded to prepare the inquest report.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_18\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                        4</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">\f4.    On the other hand Mr. Kuldip Singh, learned counsel appearing for the\n\nState while supporting the judgment of the High Court submitted that the Trial\n\nCourt committed grave error while acquitting the accused appellants, in as\n\nmuch as, the presence of the eye witnesses was natural and the delay in\n\ncommunicating the offence and lodging the First Information was well explained\n\nby the prosecution.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_20\">\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">5.    We heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and have also\n\nperused the testimonies on record in addition to other documents.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">6.    Before proceeding with the discussion on the merit of the appeal, we\n\nwould like to mention that the trial court acquitted both the accused persons.\n\nThe aforesaid order of acquittal was, however, set aside by the Division Bench\n\nof the High Court. While doing so, reasons have been given by the High Court\n\nand that too after discussing the law laid down by this Court with respect to the\n\nformalities and pre-conditions required to be followed by the court before\n\nsetting aside the order of acquittal.       We have very carefully perused the\n\naforesaid reasons and on careful perusal we found that the reasons given for\n\nsetting aside the acquittal of the accused persons are cogent and strong.\n\nThere are two eye witnesses to the occurrence, namely, Makhan Singh, PW-2,\n\nwho happened to be the son of the deceased, and Surjit Kaur, PW-3, widow of\n\nthe deceased.    Although the counsel appearing for the appellant strongly\n\nsubmitted that none of the aforesaid eye-witnesses were present at the time of\n\noccurrence but we are unable to accept the said statement for the simple\n\nreason that on the day of the alleged occurrence the deceased was going to\n\nmeet his son Buta Singh and was at the Kahangarh Railway Station to catch a\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                        5</span>\n\ftrain at 5.00 a.m. Since Buta Singh was in jail, therefore, it was natural that not\n\nonly the father, the deceased but also his wife Surjit Kaur, son Makhan Singh\n\nand other family members were accompanying the deceased so as to meet\n\nButa Singh, one of the family members in the jail. Much was said about the\n\nabsence of any train ticket with the alleged eye witnesses but absence of the\n\nsame in our considered opinion was well explained. The train was late from its\n\nscheduled time due to which the ticket counter was also not opened, and\n\ntherefore, there was no question of purchasing the tickets for traveling in the\n\ntrain and production of the same in the trial.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_23\">\n</p><p id=\"p_24\">7.     Argument was also advanced by the senior counsel appearing for the\n\nappellant regarding the conduct of the eye-witnesses in not intervening while\n\nthe accused persons were allegedly attacking the decease. PW-3, the widow\n\nof the deceased was a lady whereas Makhan Singh, PW-2, was aged only 15-\n\n16 years at the time of the alleged occurrence.          Therefore, it cannot be\n\nexpected that a lady and a small boy of 15-16 years would dare to intervene in\n\nthe attack made by the two accused persons being armed with sharp edged\n\nweapons in their hands. PW-5, Gurdas Singh, SPO reached at the scene of\n\nthe occurrence immediately after the occurrence and in fact he ran after and\n\npursued the accused persons but was unable to catch them. While scrutinizing\n\nthe evidence of PW-5, we find no reason to disbelieve the statement of the said\n\nofficer. He was not an investigating officer nor has he any connection with the\n\ncase apart from being a witness. He also flashed the initial information which\n\nwas received by PW-4, Gurdeep Singh, the investigating officer, at Railway\n\nPolice Station, Bathinda.    Much was said about the aforesaid information,\n\nwhich was sent to the investigating officer stating only that a dead body is lying\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                         6</span>\n\fat the Railway Station, Kahangarh. There is no dispute that the aforesaid\n\ninformation was very sketchy since the details of the incident were not given in\n\nthe aforesaid information. But as it was a telegraphic information, therefore, it\n\ncannot be said that the absence of material information in any manner destroy\n\nthe case of the prosecution.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_25\">\n</p><p id=\"p_26\">8.    PW-5 has clearly stated in his statement that no telephone was installed\n\nat the Railway Station, Kahangarh but there was a telephone installed at the\n\nRailway Control Room at the Railway Station which, however, was found to be\n\nout of order. He also stated that he had gone to GRP Police Post at Budhlada\n\nfrom where he sent a message to the Control Room at Bathinda on telephone\n\nabout the occurrence. The aforesaid statement clearly explains the delay in\n\nsending the information and also explained as to why detailed information\n\nregarding all materials leading to the occurrence was not mentioned by him.\n\nHe cannot be called in any manner an interested witness; in fact he was a most\n\ndis-interested witness. Nothing has been brought on record to show that he is\n\ninimical to the accused persons.   He has specifically stated in his depositions\n\nthat he saw the aforesaid accused running towards the village side carrying\n\nweapons. His presence at the spot cannot be doubted as it is established that\n\nhe was at duty at the Railway Police Post, Kahangarh, which is the place of\n\noccurrence. He has also stated in his depositions that he had in fact chased\n\nthe two accused persons up to a certain distance but could not manage to nab\n\nthem and that when he returned to the scene of occurrence, Surjit Kaur, PW-3,\n\ndisclosed to him about the occurrence. This shows that he did not see the\n\naccused persons attacking the deceased but learnt about the same from an\n\neye witness and the said information about the dead body lying at the platform\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                       7</span>\n\fwas flashed by him, for he knew that on receipt of the aforesaid information the\n\npolice should start investigation and during that course police would definitely\n\nask eye witnesses and get all the information from them. In any case, his\n\ninformation would be hearsay evidence, but as the same corroborates the\n\nsubstantive evidence of PW 2 and PW 3 the same would be admissible, as was\n\nheld in the case of <a href=\"/doc/60202/\" id=\"a_5\">Pawan Kumar v. State of Haryana</a>, [(2003) 11 SCC 241],\n\nwherein it was observed that evidence of such nature could be used to\n\ncorroborate the substantive evidence. However, in that case, as there was no\n\nsubstantive evidence the benefit of said evidence was not granted.\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_27\">9.    During the course of examination a kirpan and takua were recovered\n\npursuant to the discloser statement made by the accused.         The aforesaid\n\nweapons were shown to Dr. Kuldip Rai, PW-1, who gave his opinion that the\n\ninjuries on the person of the deceased could be inflicted by the said weapons.\n\nIn the opinion of the doctor, the death was caused due to shock and\n\nhemorrhage as a result of the injuries received, which were ante-mortem and\n\nwere sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. The aforesaid\n\nfact of recovery of the weapons and also blood stained clothes sufficiently\n\nprove and establish involvement of the accused in the occurrence as alleged by\n\nthe prosecution. We find no reason to disbelieve the eye-witnesses, namely,\n\nPW-2 - Makhan Singh and PW-3 - Surjit Kaur nor do we find any reason to\n\ndiscard the evidence of PW-5, who had reached the place of occurrence\n\nimmediately after the attack on the deceased and in fact he chased the two\n\naccused persons for some distance.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_28\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                       8</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_29\">\f10.    Upon taking all the facts into consideration including that of the fact of\n\nrecovery of the alleged weapons at the instance of the accused would explicitly\n\nprove and establish that the accused persons are guilty of the offence alleged\n\nagainst them.    We are of the considered opinion that the High Court was\n\njustified in setting aside the order of acquittal and also convicting the accused\n\npersons for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 302</a> IPC and sentencing them to undergo\n\nrigorous imprisonment for life. With the aforesaid findings we find no infirmity in\n\nthe impugned order, which we uphold and consequently dismiss the appeal.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_30\">                                                     ............................................J\n                                                                      [Dr. Arijit Pasayat]\n\n\n                                                     ............................................J\n                                                       [Dr. Mukundakam Sharma]\nNew Delhi;\n</p><p id=\"p_31\">January 20, 2009\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                        9</span>\n\f</p>","tid":1288787,"showurl":true,"citeList":[{"tid":37788,"url":null,"title":"Section 34 in The Indian Penal Code"},{"tid":1560742,"url":null,"title":"Section 302 in The Indian Penal Code"},{"tid":60202,"url":"http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgst.aspx?filename=13444","title":"Pawan Kumar & Ors vs State Of Haryana on 9 February, 1998"},{"tid":1569253,"url":null,"title":"The Indian Penal Code"}]}, {"numcites":6,"covertitles":[],"relatedqs":[{"value":"fighting","formInput":"fighting"},{"value":"provocation","formInput":"provocation"},{"value":"sudden fight","formInput":"sudden%20fight"},{"value":"undue advantage","formInput":"undue%20advantage"},{"value":"section 300","formInput":"section%20300"},{"value":"premeditation","formInput":"premeditation"},{"value":"pasayat","formInput":"pasayat"},{"value":"sudden quarrel ","formInput":"sudden%20quarrel%20"},{"value":"arijit pasayat","formInput":"arijit%20pasayat"},{"value":"section 300 of the indian penal code","formInput":"section%20300%20of%20the%20indian%20penal%20code"},{"value":"section 300 ipc","formInput":"section%20300%20ipc"},{"value":"uttarakhand","formInput":"uttarakhand"}],"citeList":[{"tid":626019,"url":null,"title":"Section 300 in The Indian Penal Code"},{"tid":1569253,"url":null,"title":"The Indian Penal Code"},{"tid":1560742,"url":null,"title":"Section 302 in The Indian Penal Code"},{"tid":1070976,"url":"http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgst.aspx?filename=29121","title":"Byvarapu Raju vs State Of Andhra Pradesh And Anr on 28 May, 2007"},{"tid":573457,"url":"http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgst.aspx?filename=26297","title":"Parkash Chand vs State Of H.P on 9 August, 2004"}],"covers":[],"title":"Buddu Khan vs State Of Uttarkhand on 12 January, 2009","publishdate":"2009-01-12","divtype":"judgments","citedbyList":[],"tid":808133,"showurl":true,"covertids":[],"firstname":null,"lastname":"pasayat","numcitedby":0,"secondname":"a","docsource":"Supreme Court of India","url":"http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgst.aspx?filename=33477","doc":"<div class=\"docsource_main\">Supreme Court of India</div>\n<div class=\"doc_title\">Buddu Khan vs State Of Uttarkhand on 12 January, 2009</div><div class=\"doc_author\">Author: .

Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the\n\nUttarakhand High Court     upholding the conviction of the appellant for\n\noffence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 302</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in\n\nshort the `<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a>').\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">\f3.    Background facts in a nutshell are as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">      On 18.9.1993 at about 8.00 p.m. in Village Fauji Math Kota within\n\nthe limits of P.S. Rudrapur (now part of District Udham Singh Nagar)\n\naccused appellant Buddu Khan and deceased Dinesh Oli were sitting\n\ntogether on a cot. Girish Chandra Chaturvedi (PW-1) was also present there.\n\nIn his presence Buddu Khan protested to the deceased as to why did he bite\n\non his cheek in the presence of his wife. Thereafter, Girish Chandra\n\nChaturvedi had left the place. When PW-1 along with Tejpal (PW-5) and Jai\n\nPrakash again came towards near the office of Co-operative Society where\n\nearlier aforesaid incident had taken place, they saw Buddu Khan hitting\n\nwith a brick on the head of Dinesh Oli and was saying that he will give the\n\ndeceased taste of biting the cheek. The three eye witnesses rushed and\n\ncaught hold of appellant. However, he escaped after freeing himself. The\n\nreport of the incident was lodged by Tejpal Singh (PW-5) with P.S.\n\nRudrapur on the very day i.e. on 18.9.1993 at about 9.30 p.m. after getting it\n\nscribed from one Dharampal. Constable Ved Pal (PW-3) who received the\n\nFirst Information Report prepared check report and made necessary entry in\n\nthe general diary, a copy of which is Ext.A-7. The crime was initially\n\ninvestigated by Sub-Inspector Surendra Singh Dagri (PW-7). He went to the\n\nspot and got prepared inquest report on 19.9.1993 at 2.00 a.m. after taking\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                     2</span>\n\fthe dead body of the deceased in his possession. He also prepared site plan.\n\nThe police also got prepared other necessary papers, sketch of the dead\n\nbody, police form No.13 and letter to the Chief Medical Officer, requesting\n\nhim for getting the autopsy done. Constable Pramod Kumar (PW-4) took the\n\ndead body in a sealed condition for post mortem examination to Soban\n\nSingh Jina Hospital, Haldwani and handed it over for the purpose. Dr. A.S.\n\nSingh (PW-2) conducted the post mortem examination on 19.9.1993 at\n\nabout 1.00 p.m. on the dead body of deceased and prepared report. He\n\nopined that cause of death was ante mortem injuries on the skull bone and\n\neffusion of blood into the brain matter. Subsequently, investigation was\n\ntaken over by Prem Singh Ahlawat (PW-6), Inspector who after\n\ninterrogation of the witnesses and completing the investigation submitted\n\ncharge sheet to the Magistrate concerned. Case was committed to the Court\n\nof Sessions.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">      The trial Court placed reliance on the evidence of the eye witnesses\n\nPWs 1 and 5. In appeal, the stand was that there was no pre-meditation. On\n\nthe contrary, because the deceased had bitten on the cheek of appellant in\n\nthe presence of his wife, there was a quarrel and in course of which the\n\nappellant picked up a brick and hit it on the head and one blow was given.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                    3</span>\n\fThe High Court did not find substance in the plea that <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 302</a> has no\n\napplication.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">4.    In support of the appeal, learned counsel for the appellant submitted\n\nthat the background facts clearly established that <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 302</a> has no\n\napplication.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">5.    Learned counsel for the respondent-State on the other hand supported\n\nthe judgment.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">6.    For bringing in operation of Exception 4 to <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 300</a> IPC it has to\n\nbe established that the act was committed without premeditation, in a\n\nsudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel without the\n\noffender having taken undue advantage and not having acted in a cruel or\n\nunusual manner.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">7.    The Fourth Exception of <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 300</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_7\">IPC</a> covers acts done in a\n\nsudden fight. The said exception deals with a case of prosecution not\n\ncovered by the first exception, after which its place would have been more\n\nappropriate. The exception is founded upon the same principle, for in both\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                   4</span>\n\fthere is absence of premeditation. But, while in the case of Exception 1\n\nthere is total deprivation of self-control, in case of Exception 4, there is only\n\nthat heat of passion which clouds men's sober reasons and urges them to\n\ndeeds which they would not otherwise do.             There is provocation in\n\nException 4 as in Exception 1; but the injury done is not the direct\n\nconsequence of that provocation. In fact Exception 4 deals with cases in\n\nwhich notwithstanding that a blow may have been struck, or some\n\nprovocation given in the origin of the dispute or in whatever way the quarrel\n\nmay have originated, yet the subsequent conduct of both parties puts them\n\nin respect of guilt upon equal footing. A `sudden fight' implies mutual\n\nprovocation and blows on each side. The homicide committed is then\n\nclearly not traceable to unilateral provocation, nor in such cases could the\n\nwhole blame be placed on one side. For if it were so, the Exception more\n\nappropriately applicable would be Exception 1.          There is no previous\n\ndeliberation or determination to fight. A fight suddenly takes place, for\n\nwhich both parties are more or less to be blamed. It may be that one of them\n\nstarts it, but if the other had not aggravated it by his own conduct it would\n\nnot have taken the serious turn it did. There is then mutual provocation and\n\naggravation, and it is difficult to apportion the share of blame which\n\nattaches to each fighter. The help of Exception 4 can be invoked if death is\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                      5</span>\n\fcaused (a) without premeditation, (b) in a sudden fight; (c) without the\n\noffender's having taken undue advantage or acting in a cruel or unusual\n\nmanner; and (d) the fight must have been with the person killed. To bring a\n\ncase within Exception 4 all the ingredients mentioned in it must be found. It\n\nis to be noted that the `fight' occurring in Exception 4 to <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 300</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_9\">IPC</a> is\n\nnot defined in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_10\">IPC</a>. It takes two to make a fight. Heat of passion\n\nrequires that there must be no time for the passions to cool down and in this\n\ncase, the parties have worked themselves into a fury on account of the\n\nverbal altercation in the beginning. A fight is a combat between two and\n\nmore persons whether with or without weapons. It is not possible to\n\nenunciate any general rule as to what shall be deemed to be a sudden\n\nquarrel. It is a question of fact and whether a quarrel is sudden or not must\n\nnecessarily depend upon the proved facts of each case. For the application\n\nof Exception 4, it is not sufficient to show that there was a sudden quarrel\n\nand there was no premeditation. It must further be shown that the offender\n\nhas not taken undue advantage or acted in cruel or unusual manner. The\n\nexpression `undue advantage' as used in the provision means `unfair\n\nadvantage'. These aspects have been highlighted in Dhirajbhai Gorakhbhai\n\nNayak v. State of Gujrat (2003 (5) Supreme 223], <a href=\"/doc/573457/\" id=\"a_11\">Parkash Chand v. State\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                     6</span>\n\fof H.P</a>. (2004 (11) SCC 381) and <a href=\"/doc/1070976/\" id=\"a_12\">Byvarapu Raju v. State of A.P. and Anr</a>.\n\n(2007 (11) SCC 218)\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">8.    Considering the background facts of the case we are of the view that\n\nException 4 to <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 300</a> applies to the facts of the case. The appropriate\n\nconviction would be under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 304</a> Part I IPC.

As noted above, while the\n\naccused questioned his conviction for offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 302</a>\n\fIPC, the State's appeal was against the acquittal in respect of offences\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/838469/\" id=\"a_2\">Sections 452</a>, <a href=\"/doc/222396/\" id=\"a_3\">427</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_4\">323</a> IPC so far as Respondent Ram\n\nKrishan is concerned and also questioning acquittal of co-accused\n\nHarminder. The High Court by the impugned judgment affirmed the order\n\nof acquittal as done by the trial court while also directing acquittal of the\n\nrespondent.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">2.    Background facts in a nutshell are as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">      Laxmi Dutt (PW-1), resident of village Mandap in Tehsil Karsog was\n\nrunning a tailoring shop at the material time in village Maghundi at a\n\ndistance of about one kilometer from his residential house. Manohar Lal\n\n(hereinafter referred to as the `deceased') was his younger brother and was\n\nrunning a shop of general merchandise at Maghandi in the business\n\npremises of PW-1 in the morning and evening, while during the day time he\n\nused to teach students of a nearby school. On 26.11.1998 at about 7.30 p.m.\n\nwhen the deceased was present in his aforesaid business premises, Ram\n\nKrishan (hereinafter referred to as the `accused') and Harmender Singh\n\n(hereafter referred to as 'the co-accused') came there while under the\n\ninfluence of liquor. They wanted to take more liquor at the said business\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                    2</span>\n\fpremises of the deceased. They asked the deceased to give them some\n\neatables. The deceased, however, asked the accused persons not to take\n\nliquor in his business premises which infuriated them and as a result they\n\nquarrelled with the deceased and slapped him. The accused persons also\n\nthrew the goods at the business premises of the deceased helter-skelter.\n\nWhen the deceased asked them not to indulge in such mischief, they asked\n\nhim to get lost. Thereupon the deceased went to the houses of Pawan\n\nKumar (PW-5) and Dogar Ram residents of village Thaltu. The deceased\n\ninformed them about the acts and conduct of the accused persons and then\n\nreturned to his business premises along with PW5 and Dogar Ram, who is\n\nelder brother of accused Harmender Singh. PW-5 and Dogar Ram requested\n\nthe accused persons not to commit the mischief in the business premises of\n\nthe deceased. However, the accused persons asked them to get lost. The\n\ndeceased then went to his house and informed Laxmi Dutt (PW-l) and\n\nKaram Dass (PW 6) and other persons present in the house about the acts\n\nand conduct of the accused persons. Laxmi Dutt (PW-1), Amba Dutt\n\n(PW2), Nanak Chand (PW3) and Preen Lal came along with the deceased\n\nand reached the business premises at about 8.15 p.m. They inquired from\n\nthe accused persons as to why they had picked up a quarrel with the\n\ndeceased? On such enquiry, the accused persons stepped out of the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                  3</span>\n\fbusiness premises of Manohar Lal (deceased), and with a stone, hit on the\n\nleft side of his head and as a consequence, the deceased dropped dead at the\n\nsite where he had sustained injury with stone Ext. P-1 and rolled down the\n\nhill-side upto a distance of about 50 feet. The accused persons thereafter\n\npelted stones on the other persons present there thereby causing simple hurt\n\nto PW6 and Dogar Ram. On hearing the noise from the spot, Man Singh\n\n(PW7) also came to the place of occurrence. He asked the accused persons\n\nnot to pelt stones and took them to their houses. PW-l, PW-7 and Khuba\n\nRaid went to the house of Krishna Devi (PW-4), Pardhan of' the Gram\n\nPanchayat and informed her of the murder of Manohar Lal (deceased). She\n\naccompanied them to the place of occurrence and inspected the dead body\n\nof the deceased. Thereafter, PW-1, PW-4 and PW-7 went to Police Station,\n\nKarsog and lodged FIR. Ext. PW-1/A under <a href=\"/doc/838469/\" id=\"a_5\">Sections 452</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_6\">323</a>, <a href=\"/doc/222396/\" id=\"a_7\">427</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_8\">302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_9\">34</a>\n\nof the Indian Penal Code against the accused persons and the investigation\n\nin the matter followed. SHO, Harbhajan Singh, S.I. (PW-13) visited the\n\nplace of occurrence and took the dead body of Manohar Lal in possession.\n\nPhotographs of the dead body and the place of occurrence were taken and\n\nthe developed photographs are Exts. PW-10/A-1 to PW-10/A-8. The report\n\nMarg Exts. PW-13/B and PW-13/C were prepared and the dead body was\n\nsent for post mortem examination. Stone Ext. PW 1 was also taken in\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                   4</span>\n\fpossession vide recovery memo. Ext.PW-4/1 and was sealed. Stone Ext. P2\n\nwas also taken in possession from the business premises of the deceased\n\nvide recovery memo Ext. PW-4/B. The post mortem of the dead body of the\n\ndeceased was conducted by Dr. Girish (PW-14) and the post mortem report\n\nissued by him is Ext. PW-14/A. As per opinion of PW- 14, the deceased\n\ndied due to the injuries to brain caused by the head injury.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">      Fourteen witnesses were examined to substantiate the prosecution\n\nversion. PWs. 1, 2, 3, 5 &amp; 6 were stated to be eye witnesses. The High court\n\nnoticed that the injury could have been caused because of the fall and not\n\nbecause of the assault made by the respondent. The basis for such\n\nconclusion was that the injuries noticed on post mortem clearly revealed\n\nthat there was a scope for the injuries having been sustained during the fall.\n\nIt was, therefore, held that the vital injury could not have been caused by the\n\naccused Ram Krishan.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">3.    In support of the appeal learned counsel for the appellant submitted\n\nthat the conclusions of the High Court are purely based on conjectures.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                     5</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">\f4.    Learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand supported the\n\njudgment.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">5.    It is to be noted that there is no dispute that the deceased died out of a\n\nhead injury. PWs 1, 2, 3, 5 &amp; 6 are eye witnesses and all of them stated that\n\nthe accused Ram Krishan hit the deceased on the left side of the head with\n\nthe stone and he rolled down. Thus there was no material before the High\n\nCourt to come to a conclusion that the death occurred due to fall. The High\n\nCourt came to a peculiar finding that it might be possible that before the\n\nstone had hit the head of the deceased, he had slipped and had rolled down.\n\nThere was no material on record in this regard.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">6.    The High Court's conclusion is that no one examined the body of the\n\ndeceased before it rolled down to ascertain whether he was alive or dead. It\n\nis relevant that all the eye witnesses had stated about the assault of the head\n\nof the deceased by the accused with the stone. Injury No. 9 was described\n\nas the fatal injury. At least five of the injuries were on the head, which can\n\nbe related to the assault by the stone and more particularly injury No. 9 viz.\n\nthe fracture in the left temporal region. Since the High Court's order is\n\nbased on surmises and conjectures, it cannot be sustained and is set aside\n\nand the order of conviction recorded by the trial court stands restored. The\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                     6</span>\n\frespondent shall surrender to custody forthwith to serve remainder of\n\nsentence.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">7.

On\n\n23/24.12.2007, the respondent No.2, who was running the guest house, barged into\n\nthe room where the appellant was staying and forcibly raped her. She has alleged\n\nthat because of this incident she was emotionally, mentally and physically wrecked\n\nand became totally uncapicitated to even think and act like a normal human being.\n\nWe have also perused the judgment of the trial Court convicting the accused on\n\nboth counts and awarded life imprisonment under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 376</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_5\">IPC</a>.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">          Under the circumstances, without expressing any opinion on the merits of\n\nthe dispute and culpability of the accused, we are certainly of the opinion that this\n\nwas not a fit case where the sentence awarded should have been suspended and the\n\naccused released on bail.

No. 9428/2009 is the father of Ms. Priyanka Todi. It is\n    alleged that the deceased Rizwanur Rahman had married Priyanka. The father of\n    Priyanka did not like the alliance and he wanted to dissuade Rizwanur Rahman to\n    keep away from the alliance. After some time the dead body of Rizwanur Rahman\n    was found in the railway track. According to prosecution, he committed suicide.\n    These appellants are arrayed as accused alleging that they had abetted the\n    commission of suicide. Thereby a charge is filed under <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_1\">Sections 306</a> and <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_2\">506</a> of IPC.\n    There is also allegations of conspiracy between the accused and a charge under\n    <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 102B</a> is also incorporated. First accused (A-1) was taken into custody on 1-\n    12-2008 and A-2 was taken into custody on 8-12-2008. A final report in this case was\n    filed on 22nd September, 2008. These appellants moved for bail and the matter came\n    up before the Division Bench of the High Court of Calcutta. The High Court refused\n    to grant the bail and that order is challenged before this Court.

That matter is pending consideration before the High Court of\nCalcutta, therefore, it is alleged that the trial is likely to be delayed and the appellants\nhave to be in jail for a long period. The appellants' counsel also stated that the final\nreport has already been filed and the accused need not be detained in jail further.\nThe Additional Solicitor General strongly opposed the bail applications and also\nexplained the involvement of the accused in this case. Learned Counsel also pointed\nout that these accused, being highly influential persons, are likely to tamper with the\nevidence and may dissuade the witnesses from giving proper evidence in court.\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">     Having regard to the nature of charge and also to the fact that the matter has\nalready been stayed, we feel that the accused be released on bail on some stringent\nconditions.\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">The appellants are directed to be released on bail on executing bond for a sum of Rs.\n1,00,000/- each to the satisfaction of the City Sessions Court, Calcutta with two\nsolvent sureties for the like amount.

By the impugned order, the court\n\n     has allowed the writ petition by quashing the order dated 01.09.2007\n\n     passed by the Additional District Judge, Court No.1, Meerut and\n\n     further has remanded the matter to the Revisional Authority to pass\n\n     fresh order in the light of observations made after affording sufficient\n\n     opportunity to the parties.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_3\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                         1</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_4\">\f3) The appellant is the owner of a Shop No. 570. Budhana Gate, Meerut,\n\n   where respondent no.1 is the occupant on monthly rent of RS. 400.\n\n   On 23.04.1999, an application was made by respondent no.2 before\n\n   the Rent Control and Eviction Officer stating that vacancy be\n\n   declared as the respondent no.1 has obtained allotment order by the\n\n   appellant by concealing the fact that he is already in occupation of\n\n   three other shops.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">4) The Competent Authority after obtaining a report from the Rent\n\n   Control Inspector and after having heard the parties vide its order\n\n   dated 28.09.2005 has observed that as the respondent no.1 has\n\n   obtained the possession of the disputed shop by playing fraud, and\n\n   therefore, the allotment of the disputed shop happens to be nullity and\n\n   is void, and thus the said shop is liable to be declared vacant.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">5) Neither the respondent no.1 nor the appellant challenged the order\n\n   dated 28.09.2005, thus it has become final. Appellant after\n\n   declaration of vacancy made an application for release of the disputed\n\n   shop before the Delegated Authority. The Delegated Authority after\n\n   considering the genuine and bonafide need of the appellant allowed\n\n   the release application in favor of the petitioner under sec. 16 of the\n\n   act, vide its order dated 30.11.2005.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                      2</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">\f6) Respondent no.1 being aggrieved by the order filed a revision petition\n\n   before the Revisional Authority on the ground that no question of\n\n   release of the disputed shop in favor of appellant arises as the said\n\n   shop is not vacant and had been duly and properly allotted to the\n\n   respondent no.1. However, respondent no.1 did not challenge the\n\n   order of vacancy. Revisional Authority again went into details of the\n\n   case and vide its order dated 01.09.2007, declared that the property in\n\n   question was not vacant and was in occupation of the respondent no.1\n\n   as a valid allotee and the allotment in favor of respondent no.1 has\n\n   not been cancelled in accordance with provisions of law, therefore the\n\n   impugned order is liable to be set aside.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">7) Being aggrieved by the order dated 01.09.2007, appellant filed a Civil\n\n   Misc. Writ Petition before the High Court for quashing the said order\n\n   passed by the Revisional Authority.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">8) The High Court, allowed the writ petition vide its order dated\n\n   24.11.2008, quashing the order passed by the Revisional Authority\n\n   dated 01.09.2007 and has remanded the matter to the Revisional\n\n   Authority to pass an appropriate order, on the ground that Revisional\n\n   Authority has failed to take into consideration the fact, that, if the\n\n   order of vacancy has become final and it has never been challenged\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                      3</span>\n\f   by aggrieved person then the question of allotment or question of\n\n   release in favour of the landlord cannot be raised by the person\n\n   concerned without challenging the order of vacancy unless and until\n\n   the premises in dispute is declared vacant by an authority competent\n\n   to do that is set aside. Aggrieved by this order the appellant is before\n\n   us in this appeal.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">9) The High Court while exercising its discretionary and extraordinary\n\n   jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 226</a> has remanded the matter back to the\n\n   Revisional Authority to pass an appropriate order with certain\n\n   directions after going into the merits of the case.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">10)The basic principle of <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 136</a> is that if a litigant feels that\n\n   injustice has been done by a Court or any other body charged with\n\n   administration of justice, there is one superior court he may always\n\n   approach and which, in its discretion, may give him special leave to\n\n   appeal so that justice may be done: (1996) 1 SCJ 786, 803.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">11)It is not possible to define with any precision, the limitations on the\n\n   exercise of the discretionary jurisdiction vested in the Supreme Court\n\n   by the constitutional provision made in <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 136.</a> The limitations\n\n   whatever they be, are implicit in the nature and character of the power\n\n   itself. It being an exceptional and over-riding power, naturally, it has\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                       4</span>\n\f   to be exercised sparingly and with caution and in special and\n\n   extraordinary situations.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">12)It is well settled that though special leave is granted, the discretionary\n\n   power which is vested in the Court at the stage of the special leave\n\n   petition continues to remain with the Court even at the stage when the\n\n   appeal comes up for hearing and when both sides are heard on merits\n\n   in the appeal: (1999) 2 SCC 321.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">13)In view of above, in our opinion although leave has been granted but\n\n   we do not find a need to exercise the discretionary powers under Art.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">   136. The matter has already been discussed by various Authorities\n\n   and the same has been remanded back by the High Court and as such\n\n   no extraordinary situation arises. It will be proper that the Revisional\n\n   Authority decides the matter again.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_17\">14)Therefore without going into the merits of the case, we dismiss the\n\n   appeal. However, we reserve liberty to the appellant to raise all such\n\n   contentions which are available to him including certain contentions\n\n   raised in this appeal before the Revisional Authority. We direct the\n\n   Revisional Authority to adjudicate upon the matter independently\n\n   untrammeled by the observations and orders made by the High Court.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">15)The appeal is dismissed accordingly. No order as to costs.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                        5</span>\n\f                    .......................................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">                    [ TARUN CHATTERJEE ]\n\n\n\n\n                    .......................................J.\n                    [ H.L.

Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a learned Single\n\nJudge of the Karnataka High Court allowing the appeal filed by the\n\nclaimants-respondents. Background facts in a nutshell are as follows:\n\f      On 19.3.1998 a bus owned by the appellant-corporation was plying\n\nbetween Erode to Mysore via Nanjangud. At about 8.15 p.m. one Jayasheela\n\n(hereinafter referred to as the `deceased') who was driving two wheeler\n\nsustained injuries, because the bus dashed against the deceased who died on\n\nthe spot. Respondent No.1 the widow of the deceased and his two minor\n\nchildren filed a Claim Petition claiming compensation in terms of <a href=\"/doc/136948773/\" id=\"a_1\">Section\n\n166</a> of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (in short the `Act'). Appellant filed its\n\nobjections denying the liability and took the stand that the accident occurred\n\nbecause of the negligence on the part of the deceased. The first Additional\n\nCivil Judge (Sr. Division) and Motor Accidents Claim Tribunal, Mysore (in\n\nshort the `MACT') awarded a sum of Rs.1,83,500/- as compensation\n\nalongwith 6% interest from the date of filing the Claim Petition.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">      Questioning quantum of the compensation, respondents Nos.1, 2 and\n\n3 filed an appeal before the High Court.

The accident took place\n\non 19.3.1998. The deceased according to the post mortem report was aged\n\nabout 24 years. Though it was claimed that he was getting salary of\n\nRs.2,500/- p.m., there was no evidence adduced to substantiate the claim.\n\nThe MACT noticed that no evidence was adduced to substantiate the\n\nincome and, therefore, notional income of Rs.1,500/- p.m. was fixed. One-\n\nthird was deducted for personal expenses. The High Court did not indicate\n\nany reason to fix the income at Rs.2,500/- p.m. though it deducted one-third\n\nfor personal expenses.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                    3</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">\f5.

In a public interest litigation\n\nfiled before the High Court of Jammu &amp; Kashmir, the Division Bench of the\n\nHigh Court gave\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                     -2-</span>\n\ncertain directions regarding basic infrastructure facilities which are to be\n\nprovided in the hospitals and other clinical establishments. The petitioner in\n\nthe public interest litigation alleged that many of the hospitals in the State\n\nof\n\nJammu and Kashmir are not having adequate facilities and State Authorities\n\nare not taking care to insist that basic facilities should be there in the\n\nhospitals.   It is alleged that licenses are issued for running these type of\n\ninstitutions without being any proper guidelines and requested       the High\n\nCourt to issue appropriate guidelines.     The High Court considered these\n\nmatters and directed the Chief Secretary of the State of Jammu and Kashmir\n\nto constitute a committee to be headed by Principal Secretary to\n\fGovernment, Health and Medical Education Department and comprising of\n\ntwo Principals, Government Medical Colleges at Srinagar and Jammu; two\n\nPrincipals of Government Dental Colleges at Srinagar and Jammu; two\n\nDirectors of Health Services of Kashmir and Jammu Provinces; Director,\n\nSher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Soura, Srinagar and Chief\n\nEngineer of UEED, and the committee was directed to evolve and formulate\n\nsuitable criteria/norms for registration of private hospitals/nursing homes\n\nand clinical establishments/laboratories. The Committee submitted a report\n\nand also opined that the norms should be established       for   hospitals,\n\nclinics, nursing homes and\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                   -3-</span>\n\ndiagnostic centres. This was approved by the Government and issued in the\n\nForm - Norms for Registration &amp; Licensing of Nursing Homes and Clinical\n\nEstablishments-2006.    The hospitals were divided into two categories -\n\nnursing homes upto 25 beds and nursing homes above 25 beds. Detailed\n\nguidelines have been given regarding the various facilities that are to be\n\nmade available to the patients. The present appellants before us who are\n\nrunning hospitals/nursing homes/clinics have already been given licenses by\n\nthe Government.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">           The learned counsel appearing for the appellants contended\n\nbefore us that these appellants are running these institutions for the last\n\fseveral years and some of them are situated within the city limits of Jammu\n\nand Srinagar and it is difficult for them to acquire more space to provide\n\nthese facilities.   It is also contended that if these additional facilities are\n\nprovided, the expenses for health care itself will go up and ordinary citizens\n\nwill not be able to avail the benefits of these private hospitals. It is also\n\nargued that these sophisticated facilities could be provided only by few\n\nprivate hospitals which has got enormous economic power and appellants\n\nwould not be in a position to give all these facilities.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">             Learned counsel appearing for the State contended that these\n\nguidelines have been issued after considering all relevant facts and they are\n\nbasically essential for providing\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                        -4-</span>\n\nthe health care to the citizens of the State. It is also argued that if any of the\n\nhospitals/clinics or other centres do not have these facilities they can seek\n\nexemption upto 25% as provided in the guidelines.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">             Our attention was drawn to the various parameters which are\n\nlaid down in the guidelines. Care has been taken to provide facilities to the\n\npatients by the health care units.       We do not think that these norms are\n\nviolative of any rights of the appellants. However, we have noticed that all\n\nthese hospitals/clinics and other centres had been in existence for fairly a\n\nlong period and they had started these units under proper license on the\n\nbasis of   the then     existing    rules.   The   hospitals   owned   by   these\n\fappellants are lacking any of the facilities which are to be provided as per\n\nthe new guidelines, they are to be given six months time to update the\n\nfacilities in accordance with the norms laid down by the Government. If any\n\nstructure or alteration is required for hospital/building, the appellants be\n\ngiven one year time to comply with it.          If the appellants are seeking\n\nexemption of the guidelines or modification, they may file proper application\n\nto the Director of Health Services and it is for the       Director      of   Health\n\nServices to consider the individual\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                      -5-</span>\n\napplication and on hearing the appellants may pass appropriate orders\n\nregarding 25% exemption permissible as per the guidelines.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">            The appeals are disposed of accordingly.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">                                      ...................CJI\n                                                   (K.G.

There is no dispute that on 28th October, 1982,\n\n     one Smt. Shammi Verma was allotted plot No.94-D\n\n     in   the       Development     Scheme    of     256    Acres     at\n\n     Balmik     Nagar,      Ludhiana,      under     Memo     No.9913\n\n     dated      26th    October,      1982      issued        by    the\n\n     Improvement        Trust,     Ludhiana.       Although,        Smt.\n\n     Verma deposited the amounts which were required\n\n     to   be    paid    against     such     allotment,      she     was\n\n     informed by the respondent No.1 by its letter\n\n     dated     2nd   January,      1989,   that    the     Trust    was\n\n     unable to make over possession of the plot to\n\n     her.       Subsequently,       Smt.     Verma    was    allotted\n\n     another plot, being No.91-B and an agreement to\n\n     sell was also executed in her favour.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                                                   3</span>\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">4.   On     11th   May,    1989,        the    appellant        herein\n\n     acquired the said plot No.91-B from Smt. Verma\n\n     and such transfer was also permitted by the\n\n     Trust.         Surprisingly, however, three months\n\n     later on 14th August, 1989, when the appellant\n\n     applied for approval of the site plan submitted\n\n     by him, he came to learn that the allotment of\n\n     plot No.91-B in favour of Smt. Shammi Verma had\n\n     been     cancelled     on     the        ground     that     such\n\n     allotment had been made by one Shri S.S. Mann,\n\n     who was not competent to make such allotment.\n\n     The      appellant         allegedly         made       various\n\n     representations       to     the    respondent       Trust    and\n\n     also    to    the   Government      and    on     consideration\n\n     thereof       the    Trust     was        directed     by     the\n\n     Government to restore the plot in question to\n\n     the appellant and consequently the allotment in\n\n     favour of Smt. Verma stood restored. It is the\n\n     case of the appellant that since the interest\n\n     of Smt. Verma devolved upon him as her approved\n\n     transferee, possession of plot No.91-B ought to\n\n     have been made over to him.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                                                4</span><p id=\"p_9\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">5.   However,    since    the     appellant     was    unable    to\n\n     obtain     any   relief    from   the    respondents,       he\n\n     filed    Civil   Writ     Petition      No.17103    of    2003\n\n     before the High Court seeking directions upon\n\n     the respondents to allot any alternative plot\n\n     to the appellant in lieu of plot No.94-D in\n\n     Balmik Nagar, Ludhiana.              While disposing of\n\n     the writ petition on 31st October, 2003, the\n\n     High Court directed the respondents to pass an\n\n     appropriate speaking order on the appellant's\n\n     representation within four months from the date\n\n     of the order upon production of a certified\n\n     copy thereof.       Pursuant to the said directions,\n\n     the Chairman of the Trust heard the appellant\n\n     on 11th February, 2004, but rejected his claim\n\n     on   the    ground    that     although     the    plot    in\n\n     question had been allotted to Smt. Shammi Verma\n\n     as a Local Displaced Person, she was not the\n\n     owner of any portion of the land acquired by\n\n     the Trust and was not a Displaced Person, which\n\n     was the eligibility criteria for coming under\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                                                  5</span>\n\n\n     the Scheme.        Even the subsequent change in the\n\n     allotment was effected by an officer who was\n\n     neither authorized nor entitled to do so.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">6.   The decision of the Chairman of the Trust was\n\n     challenged by the appellant in Writ Petition\n\n     No.11844 of 2004, wherein various reliefs were\n\n     prayed for and in particular for restoration of\n\n     plot    No.91-B,    Rajguru    Nagar,         Ludhiana.      On\n\n     being    served     with    notice,       the    respondents\n\n     herein filed their          written statement            on 23rd\n\n     December,       2005,    claiming        that     since     the\n\n     predecessor-in-interest           of    the   appellant     was\n\n     ineligible for allotment of the plot in her\n\n     name,   the     appellant    could      not    get   a   better\n\n     right    than    she    enjoyed    in    respect     of    plot\n\n     No.91-B subsequently offered to her in lieu of\n\n     plot No.94-D.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">7.   The High Court dismissed the writ petition by\n\n     holding that the appellant did not have any\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                                                  6</span>\n\n\n     independent    right     in   the    plot     and       as       a\n\n     transferee     his    fortunes      depended       on        the\n\n     fortunes of the transferor.            The High Court\n\n     having dismissed the civil writ petition, any\n\n     claim made by the appellant either over plot\n\n     No.94-D or plot No.94-B also stood rejected.\n\n     However, according to the appellant, since a\n\n     mistake had been committed by the respondents\n\n     themselves    at   the   initial    stage    and    various\n\n     transactions had already taken place in respect\n\n     of the plot in question, the cancellation of\n\n     the allotment which stood transferred to the\n\n     appellant with the permission of the Trust and\n\n     its authorities, was unacceptable. However, as\n\n     indicated hereinbefore, the said argument did\n\n     not   find   favour   with    the   High    Court,      which\n\n     dismissed the writ petition, which has given\n\n     rise to the present appeal.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">8.   On behalf of the appellant it was urged that\n\n     the transfer effected in his favour with the\n\n     approval of the Trust created an interest in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                                                           7</span>\n\n\n     the plot in his favour which was independent of\n\n     and    not     dependent       on    the    allotment          made    in\n\n     favour of Smt. Shammi Verma.                    It was urged that\n\n     after the transfer was effected in his name on\n\n     11th May, 1989, a fresh right accrued in the\n\n     appellant's       favour       and    Smt.       Verma    ceased       to\n\n     have any interest in the plot thereafter and,\n\n     in any event, she had no subsisting right in\n\n     the     plot     on    14th     August,         1989,     when        the\n\n     allotment was cancelled.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">9.   It was also urged that the amounts deposited\n\n     for     allotment       of     the    plot       had     yet    to     be\n\n     refunded and if the respondents were determined\n\n     to     re-allot       the     plot    on     fresh       terms,       the\n\n     appellant       was    willing       to    pay    any     additional\n\n     amount that might be imposed to retain the plot\n\n     or even for a fresh allotment in his name, in\n\n     the special facts of the case.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_18\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">10. The submissions made on behalf of the appellant\n\n     were     vehemently          opposed       on    behalf        of     the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                                                      8</span>\n\n\n    respondents        and     on        their     behalf      it     was\n\n    maintained        that     since        the     predecessor-in-\n\n    interest of the appellant, Smt. Shammi Verma,\n\n    was   not      eligible    for       allotment       of   any    plot\n\n    under     the     Scheme,       the     allotment         had    been\n\n    rightly terminated and the appellant could not\n\n    derive    any     right    thereto       on    account      of    the\n\n    transfer made in his favour.                   According to the\n\n    respondents, the appellant would have to sink\n\n    or swim with the fortunes of his transferor as\n\n    no independent right had been acquired by him\n\n    by virtue of such transfer.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_20\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">11. Having      considered         the     submissions        made     on\n\n    behalf      of    the     respective          parties      and    the\n\n    materials on record, we are unable to accept\n\n    the     case     as     made    out     on     behalf      of     the\n\n    appellant.        We agree with the Chairman of the\n\n    Trust that notwithstanding the fact that the\n\n    transfer of the plot in favour of the appellant\n\n    had     been     duly    approved       by     the    Trust,     the\n\n    appellant did not acquire any independent right\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                                                          9</span>\n\n\nin    the    plot    and        he    only       acquired      whatever\n\nrights the transferor or the original allottee\n\nhad   therein.             The       position       may       have       been\n\ndifferent      if     after           the    transfer          a        fresh\n\nallotment      had    been           made    in     favour         of    the\n\nappellant.        The defect in the allotment made in\n\nSmt. Shammi Verma's favour, on account of her\n\nineligibility         to     avail          of    the     Scheme          for\n\nrehabilitation        of        Locally      Displaced         Persons,\n\nwas     inherited          by        the     appellant          as        her\n\ntransferee.          The view taken by the Chairman of\n\nthe   Trust    in     his       order       dated      11th   February,\n\n2004 and affirmed by the High Court, cannot be\n\nfaulted.            However,         since       the    transfer         was\n\neffected     in     the    appellant's            favour       with       the\n\napproval of the Trust before the allotment was\n\ncancelled, the appellant's case could have been\n\ntreated      differently             in     the        special          facts\n\nthereof.       While the allotment of the plot was\n\nmade in Smt. Verma's favour on 28th October,\n\n1982, it was after almost seven years that the\n\norder   of    cancellation             of    such      allotment          was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                                                     10</span>\n\n\n    passed by the Trust, during which period not\n\n    only had the allotment been altered from one\n\n    plot to another plot, but even the transfer in\n\n    favour of the appellant had taken place.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">12. We,     accordingly,         dispose      of     the    appeal    by\n\nmodifying the judgment and order of the High Court\n\ndated    30th   January,        2006,   and    the    order    of    the\n\nChairman,       Improvement       Trust,      Ludhiana      dated    11th\n\nFebruary, 2004, and directing the said Chairman to\n\nreconsider the case of the appellant in the light\n\nof the submissions made on his behalf that he was\n\nwilling to pay such additional amount as may be\n\nlevied    for     a     fresh    allotment      of    the     plot    in\n\nquestion in his favour, after giving the appellant\n\na reasonable opportunity of being heard, in the\n\nevent the said plot has not been re-allotted in the\n\nmeantime.

This appeal is directed against the judgment and order\n\nof the High Court     of Karnataka dated 17.8.2007 passed in\n\nRFA No. 959 of 2001       which was allowed in part reducing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                    2</span>\n\n\nthe amount of damages of Rs. 1,26,055.87 granted by the\n\ntrial court to that of Rs. 48,556/- only with interest @ 6%\n\nfrom the date of suit till realization.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">3.     Brief facts needed for disposal of this appeal are as under:\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">4.     The appellant - M/s. Malnad Traders (hereinafter\n\nreferred    to   as    \"the   appellant   firm\")   is   a   registered\n\npartnership firm carrying on its business in Rice Mills and Oil\n\nMills at Shimoga in various buildings, godowns and open\n\nyards. On 7.12.1982, the entire premises of the appellant\n\nfirm    including     buildings,   machineries,    equipments     and\n\nstocks in trade were insured with the respondent - M/s. New\n\nIndia Assurance Company Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as\n\n\"the respondent company\") under the fire insurance policy\n\nbearing No.1229400593.             On 26.3.1983, there was a fire\n\naccident in the business premises of the appellant firm\n\nresulting in damage to the insured properties and as well as\n\ninjuries to two of its employees. On 11.4.1983, a detailed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                 3</span>\n\n\nreport of the incident and extent of damages suffered was\n\nsent to the respondent company.               After completing the\n\nformalities,    the   Surveyor   of    the   respondent   company\n\ninspected the premises and prepared a detailed report about\n\nthe extent of damages caused to the properties of the\n\nappellant firm. Thereafter the appellant firm lodged its claim\n\nwith the respondent company amounting to Rs. 3,33,056.87\n\nas compensation for damages caused to its properties due\n\nto the fire accident along with documentary evidence. On\n\nfailure of the respondent company in settling the claim, the\n\nappellant firm served a legal notice on 5.7.1984 which\n\nremained       uncared   for   by     the    respondent   company.\n\nThereafter the appellant firm filed the suit bearing No. 61 of\n\n1986 claiming inter alia an amount of Rs. 3,33,055.87\n\ntowards damages along with interest @ 19.5% per annum\n\nbefore the Principal Civil Judge (Sr. Dn.) and C.J.M. at\n\nShimoga. The Principal Civil Judge, Shimoga decreed the\n\nsuit for a sum of Rs. 1,26,055.87 and awarded interest at\n\n6% from the date of filing of the suit till realization. The\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                4</span>\n\n\nrespondent company being aggrieved by the same filed RFA\n\nNo. 959 of 2001 before the High Court of Karnataka at\n\nBangalore which was allowed in part reducing the amount\n\nof damages of Rs. 1,26,055.87 granted by the trial court to\n\nthat of Rs. 48,556/- with interest @ 6% from the date of\n\nfiling of the suit till realization. Hence this appeal.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">5.   We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant\n\nand perused the impugned judgment and the material made\n\navailable on record. Despite service of notice none appeared\n\non behalf of the respondent company.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">6.   Appearing    on   behalf   of the    appellant,      Shri   G.V.\n\nChandrashekar, learned counsel submitted that the High\n\nCourt has committed serious error in reducing the amount\n\nof damages without assigning any reason whatsoever. It\n\nwas also submitted that the High Court was under an\n\nerroneous impression as if the appellant was seeking further\n\nenhancement of the claim and in the process made an\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                             5</span>\n\n\nobservation commenting as if the appellant manipulated and\n\naltered the documentary evidence.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">7.    It is to be noted that     both the courts concurrently\n\nfound that the insurance coverage was in respect of entire\n\npremises and machinery installed therein and the policy was\n\nalive and in force on the date of fire accident. The appellate\n\ncourt even rejected the submission of the respondent\n\ncompany that the appellant under document Exhibit D-5\n\nagreed to receive a sum of Rs. 21,440/- only in full and final\n\nsettlement of the claims. The appellate court in this regard\n\ncame to the conclusion that there was no proof of full and\n\nfinal settlement of claims in terms of document Exhibit D-5.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">8.   The damages claimed by the appellant firm were\n\nclassified under the following heads:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     1.   Damage to building.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     2.   Damage to machinery\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">     3.   Damage to electrical wiring.</blockquote><p id=\"p_15\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                               6</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">     In support of the claim the appellant firm relied on the\n\ndocuments viz. bills (Exhibit P-6 to Exhibit P-213) and also\n\noral evidence of PW-2 to PW-9.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_17\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">9.   PW-2 Ramachandrappa, a building contractor has been\n\nexamined who stated in the evidence that a sum of Rs.\n\n30,000/- was spent for purchase of materials and a sum of\n\nRs. 5,000/- was paid for labour charges towards the civil\n\nworks   of   the   building.   The   learned   trial   court   upon\n\nappreciation of the evidence allowed only a sum of Rs.\n\n5,000/- towards labour charges and the amount spent\n\ntowards purchase of building materials was disallowed for\n\nwant of proof. The learned appellate court construed the\n\nfinding of the trial court as if the appellant firm preferred\n\nappeal in that regard and in the process came to the\n\nconclusion that there was no proof regarding the amount\n\nspent for purchase of materials. In fact, the trial court did\n\nnot award any amount in that regard. The approach adopted\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                               7</span>\n\n\nby the appellate court is more or less similar in respect of all\n\nthe issues.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_19\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_20\">10. The appellate court went on upholding the findings\n\nrecorded by the trial court which actually were not in favour\n\nof the appellant firm. The whole approach adopted by the\n\nHigh Court was as if the appellant firm preferred the first\n\nappeal without any merit whatsoever.           The first appeal, in\n\nfact, was preferred by the respondent company.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">11. The appellate court having upheld and accepted the\n\nreasoning of the trial court       without recording any reason\n\nwhatsoever    modified   the   amount     of    damages    of   Rs.\n\n1,26,055.87 awarded by the trial court to that of Rs.\n\n48,556/-.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_22\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">12. A perusal of the trial court judgment discloses that it\n\nhad not only taken note of oral evidence but of each and\n\nevery document filed by the parties and recorded a specific\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                               8</span>\n\n\nfinding in respect of each of the items. The trial court held\n\nthat the appellant firm is not entitled to a sum of Rs.\n\n2,07,000/- out of the total claim of Rs. 3,33,055.87 in the\n\nfollowing manner:\n</p>\n<pre id=\"pre_2\">     1.   Item No. 71 for          Rs. 88,000.00\n\n     2.   Item No. 76 for          Rs. 30,000.00\n\n     3.   Item No. 77 for          Rs. 47,000.00\n\n     4.   Item No. 78 for          Rs. 40,000.00\n\n                    Plus                Rs.   2,000.00\n\n          Total:                   Rs.2,07,000.00\n\n\n\n</pre><p id=\"p_24\">     The reason adopted in disallowing the claims in respect\n\nof the items referred to herein above has been upheld by\n\nthe High Court but without recording any reason further\n\nreduced the amount of damages granted by the trial court.\n\nThere is no reason whatsoever based on which the High\n\nCourt could have interfered with the well                considered\n\njudgment of the trial court.       It is clear that the trial court\n\nupon appreciation of evidence upheld the receipts in exhibit\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                             9</span>\n\n\nP-70, P-71, P-72, P-75, P-77, P-181 and P-183. The trial\n\ncourt also relied upon exhibit P-190 and P-199.      The trial\n\ncourt relying upon exhibit P-190, exhibit P-188 and exhibit\n\nP-199 and for the detailed reasons had granted Rs. 5,000/-,\n\nRs. 8,000/- and Rs. 5,000/- respectively under the said\n\ndocuments. Total amount thus comes to Rs. 1,26,055.87.\n\nThe trial court after an elaborate consideration rightly\n\ndeducted the claim in respect of item Nos. 71, 76, 77 and\n\n78 and accordingly allowed only a sum of Rs. 1,26,055.87\n\ntowards the damages.     There is not a single reason in the\n\njudgment of the High court for reducing the quantum of\n\ndamages awarded by the trial court.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_25\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_26\">13. For the aforesaid reasons, the appellant succeeds in\n\nthis appeal.   The impugned judgment of the High court\n\nmade in RFA No. 959 of 2001 is set aside and the decree\n\nand judgment of the trial court is accordingly restored.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                           10</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_27\">14.

In a public interest litigation\n\nfiled before the High Court of Jammu &amp; Kashmir, the Division Bench of the\n\nHigh Court gave\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                     -2-</span>\n\ncertain directions regarding basic infrastructure facilities which are to be\n\nprovided in the hospitals and other clinical establishments. The petitioner in\n\nthe public interest litigation alleged that many of the hospitals in the State\n\nof\n\nJammu and Kashmir are not having adequate facilities and State Authorities\n\nare not taking care to insist that basic facilities should be there in the\n\nhospitals.   It is alleged that licenses are issued for running these type of\n\ninstitutions without being any proper guidelines and requested       the High\n\nCourt to issue appropriate guidelines.     The High Court considered these\n\nmatters and directed the Chief Secretary of the State of Jammu and Kashmir\n\nto constitute a committee to be headed by Principal Secretary to\n\fGovernment, Health and Medical Education Department and comprising of\n\ntwo Principals, Government Medical Colleges at Srinagar and Jammu; two\n\nPrincipals of Government Dental Colleges at Srinagar and Jammu; two\n\nDirectors of Health Services of Kashmir and Jammu Provinces; Director,\n\nSher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Soura, Srinagar and Chief\n\nEngineer of UEED, and the committee was directed to evolve and formulate\n\nsuitable criteria/norms for registration of private hospitals/nursing homes\n\nand clinical establishments/laboratories. The Committee submitted a report\n\nand also opined that the norms should be established       for   hospitals,\n\nclinics, nursing homes and\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                   -3-</span>\n\ndiagnostic centres. This was approved by the Government and issued in the\n\nForm - Norms for Registration &amp; Licensing of Nursing Homes and Clinical\n\nEstablishments-2006.    The hospitals were divided into two categories -\n\nnursing homes upto 25 beds and nursing homes above 25 beds. Detailed\n\nguidelines have been given regarding the various facilities that are to be\n\nmade available to the patients. The present appellants before us who are\n\nrunning hospitals/nursing homes/clinics have already been given licenses by\n\nthe Government.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">           The learned counsel appearing for the appellants contended\n\nbefore us that these appellants are running these institutions for the last\n\fseveral years and some of them are situated within the city limits of Jammu\n\nand Srinagar and it is difficult for them to acquire more space to provide\n\nthese facilities.   It is also contended that if these additional facilities are\n\nprovided, the expenses for health care itself will go up and ordinary citizens\n\nwill not be able to avail the benefits of these private hospitals. It is also\n\nargued that these sophisticated facilities could be provided only by few\n\nprivate hospitals which has got enormous economic power and appellants\n\nwould not be in a position to give all these facilities.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">             Learned counsel appearing for the State contended that these\n\nguidelines have been issued after considering all relevant facts and they are\n\nbasically essential for providing\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                        -4-</span>\n\nthe health care to the citizens of the State. It is also argued that if any of the\n\nhospitals/clinics or other centres do not have these facilities they can seek\n\nexemption upto 25% as provided in the guidelines.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">             Our attention was drawn to the various parameters which are\n\nlaid down in the guidelines. Care has been taken to provide facilities to the\n\npatients by the health care units.       We do not think that these norms are\n\nviolative of any rights of the appellants. However, we have noticed that all\n\nthese hospitals/clinics and other centres had been in existence for fairly a\n\nlong period and they had started these units under proper license on the\n\nbasis of   the then     existing    rules.

Rao Constructions gave a post-dated cheque bearing\nNo.929131 dated 17th October, 1996, to the appellant on 17th April, 1996 for\nrepayment of the loan. The Manager of Chembur Branch of the Bank guaranteed\nencashment of the cheque. However, on 16th July, 1996, that is a day before the due\ndate of payment, the Branch Manager asked the appellant not to present the cheque.\nOn the next day, cheque No.929131 was taken from the appellant and another cheque\nbearing No.217401 dated 17th October, 1996 was issued for Rupees twenty lakhs. The\nbank gave fresh guarantee to the appellant that the cheque will be\n                                                                                  ....2/-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                           -2-</span>\n<p id=\"p_4\">honoured on its presentation. The appellant presented the cheque on 10th April, 1997,\nfor encashment but it was returned on the same day with the remark \"insufficient\nfunds\". The appellant represented to the bank for payment of Rupees twenty lakhs\nby relying upon the guarantee given on 17th July, 1996. The Chief Manager of the\nBank sent communications dated November 16, 1998 and February 5, 1999 and\nassured the appellant that the matter is being looked into and they will get back to\nhim within few days. After fifteen days, the Chief Manager vide his letter dated 20th\nFebruary, 1999 denied the liability of the Bank to pay the amount of the cheque.\nThereupon, the appellant filed complaint before the National Commission on 18th\nOctober, 1999 which, as mentioned above, was dismissed as barred by time.\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">              From the facts narrated above, it is clear that cause of action to file the\ncomplaint had arisen on receipt of communication dated 20th February, 1999, by\nwhich the bank denied its liability to pay the amount of cheque in spite of the fact that\nthe payment of the said sum was guaranteed.

The parties are descendants\n\nof common ancestor Pusau, who partitioned his property\n\nincluding the suit land during his life time.\n\nThe suit which was filed by the appellants herein in\n\nCivil Suit No. 103A of 1997 was for declaration of\n\ntitle and permanent injunction in respect of Plot No.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                          1</span>\n\f138/6 and 207/1 situated at village Katangi and also\n\nfor permanent injunction restraining the respondents-\n\ndefendants from interfering in their possession.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">3.   Admittedly, it appears from the record that the\n\nappellants herein have disposed of plot No. 207/1.                      The\n\nsuit is only confined in respect of Plot No. 138/6.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">4.   It is the concurrent finding of both the courts\n\nbelow that the aforesaid plot was never allotted to the\n\nappellants herein in the course of partition.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">5.   Whether         the    aforesaid       plot    was    allotted      in\n\npartition in favour of the appellants herein is a pure\n\nquestion of fact.                The appellants wanted to rely on\n\ncertain documents of partition in order to contend that\n\nthe aforesaid plot was allotted in their favour.                        The\n\nconcurrent finding of both the courts is that the said\n\nclaim     is    based       on    interpolation      in   the    deed    of\n\npartition.          This is also concurrently found by both the\n\ncourts below that the appellants herein were never in\n\npossession of the said plot.                    On the other hand, the\n\nfinding        of    both    the       courts    below    is    that    the\n\nrespondents-defendants were in possession of the said\n\nplot.   All these questions are pure questions of fact.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                   2</span>\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">\f6.   The   High   Court   after   considering   these   issues\n\ninvolved in this case rightly held that, no substantial\n\nquestion of law is involved and the finding which is\n\nsought to be impugned in the second appeal is based on\n\nquestion of fact and appreciation of evidence, and they\n\ndo not call for any interference under Section 100 of\n\nCivil Procedure Code.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">7.   We are in entire agreement with the same finding of\n\nthe High Court and in our view, there is no merit in\n\nthis appeal and the same is accordingly dismissed.

The only controversy is regarding the amount on which the interest will\n\n have to be now paid, in terms of the order passed by the District Forum, as\n\n confirmed by the State and National Forum. It is clarified that under Clause-I of\n\n the relief order passed by the District Forum what was awarded was the interest\n\n on Rs.3,85,000/-, that is, the amount paid by the consumer for the plot or flat, as\n\n the case may be, which did not come into his or her possession. It is now obvious\n\n that the possession of the plot has already been given by the appellant to the\n\n respondent. The District Forum had ordered the interest to be paid on that\n\n amount up to the date when the possession was given. The dates of course in these\n\n four matters are different. It was, however, provided by Clause-2 of the order that\n\n if the amount of interest so calculated on the amounts paid by the complainant is\n\n not paid within three months then the appellant will be liable to pay further\n\n                                                             ..2/-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                               :2:</span>\n\n interest at the rate of 12% per annum. The question was on which amount the\n\f       said interest would be payable. It is clarified that the further interest would be\n\n       payable only on the amount of unpaid interest which has been quantified in\n\n       Clause-1 of the order and not on the whole amount paid by the complainant to the\n\n       appellant herein. Further it would be simple interest.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">       2.

Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a Division Bench of\n\nthe Patna High Court dismissing the Writ Petition filed by the appellant.\n\nBefore the High Court, challenge was to the order passed by the Central\n\nAdministrative Tribunal, Patna Bench (in short the `CAT'). The CAT by the\n\fimpugned order negatived the claim of the appellant for appointment to the\n\npost of Extra Departmental Branch Post Master (in short `EDBPM'). CAT\n\nheld that the claim made by the appellant cannot be accepted on two\n\ngrounds; firstly, his land was encumbered and secondly he did not file the\n\noriginal certificates with regard to his qualifications. Stand of the appellant\n\nbefore the High Court was that the conclusions relating to encumbrance of\n\nland are incorrect as the encumbrance was with regard to another plot of\n\nland and not relating to the land belonging to the appellant. It was also\n\npointed out that the certificates were produced at the time of hearing of the\n\noriginal application before the CAT. The High Court held that even if the\n\nfirst ground that the land was not encumbered is accepted, the writ petition\n\nwas to be dismissed as all the relevant documents were not produced and\n\nrespondent No.6 who was appointed had filed all the relevant documents.\n\nTherefore, the petition was dismissed.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">3.    Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the original\n\ndocuments were with the institution where the appellant was pursuing his\n\nstudies and in fact the institution had clearly certified that the original copy\n\nof the mark sheet, admit card, school leaving certificate and other\n\ndocuments submitted by the students at the time of their admission are not\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                     2</span>\n\freturned to them under an order passed by the State Government. It is the\n\nstand of the appellant that there is no requirement to produce the original\n\ndocuments.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">4.

It is not disputed that the original documents were not produced\n\nbefore the authorities because the documents were with the institution i.e.\n\nRamdayalu Singh College, Muzaffarpur and the appellant was not in a\n\nposition to produce the original documents. In view of the aforesaid it is\n\nnot necessary to examine whether there is any requirement for producing the\n\noriginal documents as observed by the departmental authorities. Respondent\n\nNo.6 is continuing in his job. Therefore, without disturbing his continuance,\n\nwe direct that in case there is any vacancy in the nearby area where the\n\nappellant can be adjusted, the same can be done by the authorities after\n\nfollowing the necessary norms.

The appellant while working as a Superintendent in the\n\noffice of the Advocate-General, Haryana made applications\n\nfor   allotment   of   a   plot    under     the   Government   employees\n\nquota in Sector 25, Panchkula and for allotment of a plot\n\nunder the general category in Sector 26, Panchkula. The\n\nHaryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA), by letter dated\n\n14.11.1994   informed      her    that   she   had   been   selected    for\n\nallotment of Plot No. 817 in Sector 26 under the general\n\ncategory in the draw of lots held on 31.10.1994.                HUDA also\n\nselected her for allotment of a plot (No. 946 in Sector 25)\n\nunder the Government employees quota.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                    2</span><p id=\"p_4\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">3.   As a person could not have allotment of more than one\n\nplot, the appellant opted for retaining the allotment of\n\nPlot No. 817 (Sector 26) under the general category, and\n\nsent a letter dated 10.3.1995 requesting for cancellation\n\nof proposed allotment of Plot No. 946 (Sector 25) under the\n\nGovernment employees quota.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">4.   HUDA, by letters dated 4.4.1995, called the appellant\n\nfor a hearing and verification of documents, stating that\n\nshe could not have more than one plot. Subsequently, HUDA\n\ncancelled the general category allotment of Plot No. 817\n\n(Sector 26) as per communication dated 20.12.1995, on the\n\nground that the appellant is not eligible for two plots and\n\nrefunded the sum of Rs.20,500/- which had been deposited as\n\nearnest money for the said plot. The appellant accepted the\n\ncancellation of allotment of Plot No. 817 (Sector 26) being\n\nunder   the   impression     that       she   will   get     Plot   No.   946\n\n(Sector 25) under the Government employees quota.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">5.   One of the requirements for confirmation of allotment\n\nof   plots    under    the     Government       employees       quota     was\n\nproduction of an Integrity Certificate from the employer\n\nwithin 90 days from the date of allotment (vide clause 10\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">(iii) of the Allotment Brochure).              As a criminal case was\n\npending   against     the    appellant,       she    could    not   get   the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                       3</span>\n\nIntegrity    Certificate        within      90       days.    She     obtained       the\n\nIntegrity     Certificate        only           on    4.8.2000,            after     the\n\nconclusion of the criminal proceedings and submitted it to\n\nHUDA on 21.8.2000.         As allotment of Plot No. 946 was not\n\nconfirmed even thereafter, she approached the High Court\n\nfor relief in Civil Writ Petition No. 11208 of 2003.                                 The\n\nHigh Court dismissed the writ petition on the ground that\n\nthe    appellant,       not      having          produced          the        Integrity\n\nCertificate within 90 days from the date of allotment, was\n\nnot   entitled    to    the     plot.           The    said        order      is   under\n\nchallenge in this appeal by special leave.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">6.    As   noticed     above,    the       appellant         was    allotted       plots\n\nboth under the general category and Government employees\n\nquota.      The      cancellation          of    allotment          under      general\n\ncategory, was on the assumption that appellant was allotted\n\nplot No.946 (Sector 25) under government employees quota.\n\nIf appellant was not entitled to allotment under government\n\nemployees quota, she was entitled to the allotment of Plot\n\nNo.817 under the general category and that could not have\n\nbeen cancelled. The appellant accepted the cancellation of\n\ngeneral category selection of Plot No. 817 (Sector 26), as\n\nshe believed that she would get Plot No. 946 (Sector 25)\n\nunder Government       employees        quota.         In     fact,      as    per   the\n\nrules, only persons who already have a plot in an Urban\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                     4</span>\n\nEstate or a confirmed allotment, are not eligible for a\n\nsecond    plot.      If   the    appellant       was     not   eligible      for\n\nallotment of Plot No. 946 under Government employees quota,\n\nshe could not have been denied allotment of Plot No. 817\n\nunder general category. Be that as it may.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">7.     On the peculiar facts and circumstances, it may not be\n\njust to deny the plot to the appellant, inspite of having\n\nbeen allotted plots, both under the general category and\n\nunder the Government employees quota. In the circumstances,\n\nwe are of the view that the HUDA should accept the belated\n\nproduction     of    Integrity       Certificate         and    confirm      the\n\nallotment of Plot No. 946 (Sector 25) to the appellant.                      We\n\nmay however make it clear that in view of the delay on the\n\npart     of   the    appellant       in     production         of   Integrity\n\nCertificate, HUDA will be entitled to charge for the plot,\n\nthe price prevailing on 21.8.2000 (the date of production\n\nof     such   certificate)      instead     of     the    allotment        price\n\napplicable in 1994-95.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">8.     We accordingly allow this appeal and direct the HUDA\n\nto allot Plot No. 946 (Sector 25), Panchkula, under the\n\nGovernment     employees     quota       subject    to    payment     by    the\n\nappellant,     the   price   applicable       as    on     21.8.2000.

Mr. Mehta, appearing in support of the appeal, has\n\ndrawn our attention to the procedure for taking disciplinary action, as was indicated\n\nin the Bipartite Settlement and has laid special emphasis on paragraph 14 of the\n\nsame which indicates that at the appellate stage, if an employee, who has been\n\ndismissed from service, asks for personal hearing, such prayer could be granted by\n\nthe Appellate Authority. In other cases, no such provision has been made.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_4\">        Mr. Mehta submitted that at the time of the disciplinary proceedings, the\n\nrespondent was given all opportunities to defend himself and has also been given a\n\nhearing by the Disciplinary Authority.

Respondents\n\nhad entered into four hire purchase agreements with the appellant, the details of which\n\nare given in synopsis 'D' to the S.L.P. paper book. Disputes arose between the parties\n\nwhich went to arbitration. Two Awards were given. Ultimately the matter came to\n\nthis Court by way of Special Leave Petition and the Awards stood confirmed. In the\n\nprocess, a period of almost ten years elapsed. Pursuant\n\n                                                                            ...2/-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">\n\n\nCA @ SLP(C) 12422/08 contd...\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                            -2-</span>\n\fto the Awards, execution proceedings, including insolvency proceedings, have been\n\ntaken. We do not wish to comment about those proceedings as the matter is sub\n\njudice.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">           Suffice it to state that after ten years, the Commission has been moved\n\nclaiming damages in which appellant herein raised the contention that it should decide\n\nthe question of maintainability of the above Compensation Application No.7/2007 as a\n\npreliminary issue.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">           According to the appellant, the said Compensation Application No.7/2007\n\namounts to abuse of process and it is this issue which the appellant wanted the\n\nCommission to be decided as a preliminary issue.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">           When the matter came for hearing, we have examined the voluminous record\n\nthreadbare. After examining the entire record, without commenting on the merits of\n\nthe case, we are of the view that the Commission has erred in holding, vide para 11,\n\nthat the question of maintainability of Compensation Application No.7/2007 is a\n\nquestion of fact and law which can be decided only when the evidence is led. It is\n\nimportant to note that in this case what the Commission ought to have done is to have\n\nexamined the scope of the arbitration proceedings. It ought to have examined the\n\npleadings before the Arbitrator before coming to the conclusion as stated hereinabove\n\nvide para 11 of the impugned judgment. The bare fact remains that\n\n                                                                        ...3/-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">\n\n\nCA @ SLP(C) 12422/08 contd...\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                          -3-</span>\n\nafter ten years and after the parties have gone through the entire gamut of the various\n\nproceedings, the matter has been moved before the Commission alleging unfair trade\n\npractice. There are various nuances of the concept of abuse of process, which includes\n\fmoving the Commission after ten years. None of these aspects have been examined by\n\nthe Commission.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_11\">           On the facts and circumstances of this case, we are of the view that the\n\nCommission should frame and decide the issue of the Complaint being an abuse of the\n\nprocess as a preliminary issue before proceeding further in the matter. We do not wish\n\nto express any opinion on that issue or on the merits of the case. We make it clear that\n\nall contentions on the preliminary issue are kept open. Any observation made in the\n\nimpugned judgment as well as herein on merits will not bind the Commission while\n\ndeciding the preliminary issue.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">           Before concluding, we are constrained to observe that certain allegations\n\nhave been made in the Compensation Application against the Chairperson of the\n\nAppellant Company. It would be open to the Commission to examine at the threshold\n\nwhether those allegations have any relevance to the Complaint filed before the\n\nCommission and, if it comes to the conclusion after hearing the parties that such\n\nallegations have no relevance to the Compensation Application, then, it may consider\n\nordering deletion of such allegations.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">           Subject to what is stated hereinabove, the impugned\n\n                                                                             ...4/-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">\n\nCA @ SLP(C) 12422/08 contd...\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                             -4-</span>\n\njudgment is set aside and the matter stands remitted to the Monopolies and Restrictive\n\nTrade Practices Commission to frame and decide the above issue as a preliminary issue\n\nwithin a period of four months.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_16\">           Civil appeal is allowed accordingly with no order as to costs.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">                                         ...................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_18\">                                                            (S.H.

Appellant claims exemption under Notification No. 30/88\n\n  dated Ist March, 1988 saying that items imported were \"heat pumps\" for space heating, water\n\n  heating and cooling applications. He placed reliance on the Table annexed to the above\n\n  Notification and claims exemption/concessional rate of duty on 160 imported items.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_4\">            At the very outset, it may be stated that this Civil Appeal is against a concurrent\n\n  findings. We may also add that the matter is highly technical. In this Civil Appeal when we\n\n  went through the judgment of the Tribunal, which is impugned judgment herein, we find that\n\n  there is a categorical finding recorded to the effect \"that the Operational Manual of the\n\n  manufacturer for the said 160 Items describe them as air-conditioner and not heat pumps\".\n\n  To be precise, the words used in the Operational Manual\n\n  were \"it is a heat pump type air conditioner\". The Operational\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                               -2-</span>\n\fManual produced by the appellant is titled as \"Air Cooled Split System Air Conditioner\".\n\nWhat is important to note is that in this case appellant is claiming the benefit of an Exemption\n\nNotification. The burden was on the appellant to prove that the appellant satisfies the terms\n\nand conditions of the Exemption Notification. It is well settled that Exemption Notification\n\nhave to be read in the strict sense. In this case the appellant had led evidence of an expert,\n\ntwice. It appears that the Operational Manual was not placed before him. No questions were\n\nasked to the expert on the terminology used in the Manual which described the imported\n\nitems as \"Heat Pump Type Air Conditioner\". Therefore, on the facts and circumstances of\n\nthe case, we do not see any reason to interfere with the concurrent findings recorded by the\n\nauthorities below.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">           However, we make it clear that on principle this judgment does not settle the law\n\nand our reasoning is based only on the facts and circumstances of this case, namely, that the\n\nappellant had failed to discharge burden placed on it while claiming the benefit of Exemption\n\nNotification.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">           Subject to what is stated above, this Civil Appeal is dismissed with no order as to\n\ncosts.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">                                                             ....................J.</p><pre id=\"pre_3\">\n                                                             [ S.H.

The trial Court considered the oral and documentary evidence produced by\nthe parties and held that the plaintiff had surrendered the lease of eastern half\n                                                                                  ....2/-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                          -2-</span>\n<p id=\"p_5\">portion of the suite plot and that he released the same in favour of defendant Nos.2\nand 3 by executing registered lease deed and also delivered possession to them. On\nthat premise, the suit of the plaintiff was dismissed.           The appellate Court\nindependently analyzed the pleadings and evaluated the evidence and confirmed the\nfindings recorded by the trial Court. The learned Single Judge framed the following\nquestion of law:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">       \"Whether the permanent lease in question could be terminated or\n       cancelled only on the verbal assertion of the landlord that he was\n       asked to recover possession of the eastern half portion by the deceased\n       plaintiff and that such surrender of lease could be validity\n       recognized?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">           However, instead of directing his attention to the afore-mentioned\nquestion, the learned Single Judge re-appreciated the entire evidence and reversed\nthe concurrent finding of fact recorded by two courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"p_6\">           It is well settled that in exercise of power under Section 100 of the Code of\nCivil Procedure, 1908, the High Court can interfere with the finding of fact only if the\nsame is perverse. In the present case, we find that the learned Single Judge did not\nfind any perversity in the findings of fact and conclusions recorded by the lower\nappellate court which is the final court of fact and yet he reversed the judgments of\nthe courts below by re-appreciating the evidence, which is legally impermissible.\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">           Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, impugned judgment is set aside and the\none passed by the lower appellate Court is restored.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">                                                                         ......................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">                                                [B.N.

The learned Single Judge has struck down\n\nSection 275(1)(aa) of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation Act, 1980. Against the said\n\ndecision, number of Writ Appeals were filed by the Corporation. It appears from the\n\nimpugned decision that at one stage, the matter stood adjourned on the ground that\n\nthe State had agreed to amend the law. However, that did not materialize. By a\n\ncryptic order, the Division Bench has stated that they have perused the judgment and\n\nthey did not find any scope for interference in the order of the learned Single Judge.\n\nWe are of the view that in matters involving constitutionality, it would not be open\n\nfor the High Court to dismiss Writ Appeals on such cryptic grounds.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_3\">                                                                        ..2/-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                         -2-</span>\n\n         In the circumstances, we set aside the impugned judgment of the Division\n\fBench and we restore A.P.O.No.233 of 2003 and other Appeals to the file of the\n\nKolkata High Court. We direct the High Court to expeditiously hear and dispose of\n\nthe said appeals in accordance with law.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">         At this stage, learned counsel appearing for the Corporation states that the\n\nCorporation prays for stay of the judgment given by the learned Single Judge. We\n\ncannot grant such a prayer particularly when we are setting aside the impugned\n\norder passed by the Division Bench. However, it would be open to the Corporation to\n\nmove the Division Bench in the pending Appeals for interim relief, if so advised.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">         Civil Appeals are, accordingly, allowed with no order as to costs.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">                                   ...................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">                                                      (S.H.

That order was challenged by\nthe appellants by filing writ petition in the High Court mainly on the ground of\nviolation of the rules of natural justice by alleging that their caste certificates were\ncancelled without issuing notice and affording them opportunity of hearing. They\nalso made a specific prayer for quashing order dated 30th March, 1999. Although the\nrespondent did not controvert the assertions contained in the writ petition, the High\nCourt dismissed the writ petition by observing that the petitioners did not challenge\norder dated 30th March, 1999 despite the fact that copy thereof was supplied to them\npursuant to the direction given by it. In our view, the High Court committed serious\nerror in dismissing the writ petition without going into the question of violation of the\nrules of natural justice.\n</p><p id=\"p_4\">                                                                                   ....2/-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                           -2-</span>\n<p id=\"p_5\">           Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, impugned order passed by the High\nCourt is set aside and order dated 30th March, 1999 passed by the Tehsildar cancelling\nthe caste certificates of the appellants is quashed.\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">           Needless to say that this order shall not preclude the Tehsildar from\npassing a fresh order after giving opportunity of hearing to the appellants.\n</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"p_7\">                                                                         ......................J.\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">                                                 [B.N.
